anup ghosh from the aerospace engineer ing department of iit kharagpur t his is the first lecture in that series to introduce with you the aircraft structures better we look into some video video starts forty-six video options like this though it may not look good to bring the detail of aircra ft structure at the first slide but this is the other way i feel better because it gives us the insight of the structure in a general se nse if we talk about structures this is an assembly of elements which has load externally applied loads or and a selfload of weight also or the weight which it is having on its own t his p articular example if we look at this example is actually a double decker aircraft fuselage cross section t his may not match exact ly with any commercial aircraft but these aircraf t fuselage section has been created in cad software and it is created to give a better feeling before we start the aircraft structures course if you look at it the most predominant thing is that the stru cture is no way solid in nature this is build up thin s ections and there are two decks below portion if you look at this portion where generally cargo goods those things are placed t his portion and as well as this portion if you look at this and this usually really passengers are carried that is wh y windows are provided here even doors are also provided here and th is is the normal way it is done video ends two hundred and forty-three so another video i would like to show you in this regard that is again a represent ative wing structure in this we will see differen t sections of the wing like the ribs the spars video starts three hundred and four in this what we see is that these shapes which are we say airfoil shape these maintain the shape of the wing t hese sections are known as spars and that way these are all built from thin work sections these are the aim of our study how each and eve ry part is designed or analyzed video ends three hundred and thirty-three but before we start into th at analysis and design we would like to go to the basics of the solids mechanics refer slide time three hundred and forty so in that concern to go through th e basics of solid mechanics it is better to go through the evolution of solid mechanics on the other way we may say that it is the history of solid mechanics and since we cannot disassociate aircraft structure from so lid mechanics so it is also the history of a ircraft structures as well refer slide time four hundred and thirteen this is a very interesting one i really feel encouraged looking at this one t his may be the first point or noted point in the history while someone did s ome experiment to find out properties of a materia l so if you look at the slide this is an introduction to fligh t vehicle structures definitely it is a common title for this portion but basically now what we will do we will consider a brief history of structural mechanics and or solid mechanics as we said the history of structural mechanics or solid mech anics is as old as civilization so this statement i have put at first because you know anything we do even if we sle ep on a cot that is a structure so whatever we do even if we think of the invention of the wheel that is also a structure anything we can imagine anything i f we think of an axe that ax e is also a structure that handle of the axe has s omebody thought of its strength somebody though t of its size and then he designed it so if you think of a spear that is also a structure so looking at that point of view it is really as old as the civilization is but the similar way if we look at the noted down history or the fast documented inve stigation that is done by leonardo da vinci though leonardo da vinci is much more famous with arts and sculptures and paintings all those things we are familiar with mona lisa but see he is the person who did exp eriments with these things also if we lo ok at the setup this is a very nice interesting s etup t his is a bag c c is a bag full of sand b is a bucket and the string ab which is connected or from the horiz ontal bar is going to be tested s o what is happening from the bucket c sands are coming to the bucket b and at some point of time slowly as the load will increas e as the amount of sand will increase it will exert more force on the string and we can find out we can estimate a measure of how much is the strength of the string ab so this ma y be considered that the string or wire whatever we say the wire ab how much is the strength so this is the first noted point w e can say that this is the fi rst tensile testing of material so this is a really notable thing we should hono ur him with giv ing him credit but after this we will go to the other portions other portions like the history how we have come across all these analysis design and other aspects of solid mechanics and analysis of aircraft structure s refer slide time seven hundred and twenty-seven so we have segmented this lecture i have planned the lecture in three segments we were f irst considering t he elasticity stress and strain s o if we look at it if you go to the previous slide please note the time it is something in the mid of or late of 15th cent ury then what happens we denoted scientist or physicist when we say th at time everyone was physicists so galileo galilei may introduce the concept of stress concept of stress through the experimental observation of tensile testing of bar breaking is independent of length and dependent on the cross section s o it is something considered that galileo galilei is the person who first established the correlation between the length and cross section with respect to their breaking load s o he concluded that breaking is independent of length and it is dependent on the cross section various exp eriments on stone beams also he did h e did a lot of experiments on stone beams next if we look at it is say maybe in the 17th century mathematical and physical stu dies are first carried out by isaac newton with the introduction of laws o f motion this is very famous we have heard anyways three famous laws we would not spen d much time on that these are quite available in books and we are very aware of it next if we look at robert hooke now we always say it is h ook\u2019s law so what did robert ho oke said robert hooke and e mari otte in one thousand, six hundred and eighty observed that displacement is proportional to the applied load for many materials s o this is a very very common observatio n for us nowadays but they fi rst noted down this observation a bout jame s bernoulli he is one of the fa mous bernoulli family physicist s james bernoulli noted down in his last publication in the year one thousand, seven hundred and five that proper way of describing deformation was to give force per unit area or stress as a function of the elongation per unit length or strain of a material fiber under tension i t is something he is the person first said that there m ight be two terms or two way we can define one is with respect to the force per unit area and the other is with respect to t he material fiber under tension so elongation per unit length refer slide time one thousand, one hundred and fifteen then it comes about leonhard euler proposed the linear relationship between stress and strain in one thousand, seven hundred and twenty-seven sigma is equal to e epsilon e and this may be noted at this point of time that it may be noted that constant e is named after thomas young as youngs modulus in one thousand, eight hundred and seven so if we see what we generally say stress strain relation sigma i s equal to e epsilon for that only there is the contribution of leon hard euler there is the contribution of bernoulli there are contribut ions from robert hooke and mariotte so later if we look at the internal tension acting across surfaces in a deforme d solid was expressed by gottfried wilhelm leibniz in one thousand, six hundred and eighty-four and james bernoulli in one thousand, six hundred and ninety-one now with probably you have come across the mech anics course in your first year maybe in your first or second semester this is quite familiar to us that there are somet hing internal stresses interna l tension acting across the surface there are stresses which acts internally within a body but see that was first noted down by leibniz ian bernoulli in one thousand, six hundred and ninety-one bernoulli and euler introduced the idea that at a given section along the length of a beam there were internal tensions amounting to a net force and a net torque so they tried to make some correlation between the net force and torque and internal tensions euler introduced the idea of compressive normal st ress as th e pressure in a fluid h e again did further calculations for that proposition and he said that there is something c ompressive normal stresses also it is compressive in nature and that may be considered may be said as the pressure in case of fluid charle saugustin e coulomb more popularly known as coulomb was apparently the first to relate the theory of beam as a bent elastic line to stre ss and strain in an actual beam so he is the person who first assumed that he proposed that the bent elastic line has a relation with t he stress strain of the actual beam he developed the famous expression sigma is equal to m cross y by i my i this expression is real ly very very good and we use it you have done in your mechanics course all problems with this but it got introduced sometime in the late 18th century he developed the famous expression sigma equals to m by i multiplied by y for the stress due to pure bending of a homogeneous linear elastic beam so this formula holds for pure bending and he established this shear stress the concept of shear stress probably you have now but it was a say concept by parent later implemented in soil mechanics by coulomb in one thousand, seven hundred and seventy-three refer slide time one thousand, five hundred and forty-four then we say a lot of contribution is done from augustin cauchy augustin louis cost cauchy in one thousand, eight hundred and twenty-two formalized the stress concept in the context of a general 3dimensi onal theory and he showed that its properties as consisting of three by three symmetric array of numbers that transform as a tensor deriv ed the equation of motion for continuum in terms of components of stresses and ga ve the specific development of the theory of linear elasti c response for isotropic solids t his is really a b ig sentence for us to study now there are terms which are probab ly we are not familiar with like the continuum equation of motion for a continuum three by three symmetric area of num bers which is actually a tensor so but see it is better to get introduced with these things because we will be using in our later courses or m aybe in a very b rief way in this present course as part of this work cauchy also introduced the equation which express es the six components of strain three extensional and three shear in terms of derivatives of displacements for the case when all thes e derivati ves are much smaller than unity so this is del u del x equals to \u025b of x that is what he said he is in the year one thousand, eight hundred and twenty-two or in the close year he prop osed that and it was continuing s o this is something we will come back again about the further development of this c ontinuum equation who did what but before that we bett er get introduced with these thin gs which are related to the beams columns plates and shells development development in the sense analysis development how those analyse s were being slowly developed by the famous physicist refer slide time one thousand, eight hundred and twenty-two james bernoulli if you look at proposed in his final paper in the year one thousand, seven hundred and five that curvature of a beam is pro portional to the bending moment t his we know that m by e i is equa lled to one by rho and we can also see that euler in one thousand, seven hundred and forty-four and daniel bernoulli he is also from that bernoulli f amily in one thousand, seven hundred and fifty-one used the theory to address the transverse vibration of beam transverse vibration of beam is if we have in interest to look at the response of a vibrating structu re the first thing we generally study is a single degree freedom system but invariabl y it goes to the beam vibration that means if it is under dynamic load or it is vibrating because of its inertia how the response is all those things were first introduced in one thousand, seven hundred and fifty-one euler gave in one thousand, seven hundred and fifty-seven his famous analysi s of buckling or buckling of an initial ly straight beam subjected to compressive loading this euler buckling formula already we are introduced with buckling is a kind of instability and we need to under stand it we need to find out the critical load so that st ructure does not go to any unstable region and it serv es its purpose of carrying a load daniel bernoulli and euler in one thousand, seven hundred and forty-two and in forty-four introduced the strain energy per unit length for a beam proportional to the square of its curvature and regarded t he total strain energy as the quantity analogous to the potential energy of a discrete mechanical system so if we look at this statement this is a very important development this may be the fundamenta l of todays numerical analysis h e said that the s train energy per unit length is analogous to the potential energy s o this may be considered as the first statement for the analysis with respect to the energy we will see many more other things are also developed and that slowly has invented the process of numerical meth ods like finite element methods following from the principle of virtual work as introduced by john bernoulli euler rendered the energy stationary and in this way developed the calculus of variations as an approach to the equations of e quilibrium a nd motion of elastic structures s o this energy stationar y and the calculus of variation these are the two fundamental mathematical tools which further laid down the process of invention of finite element analysis or other numerical methods an d approximate methods what we generally learn refer slide time two thousand, two hundred and thirty-nine so we were talking about the variational approach v ariational approach played really a major role in the development of the theory of small transverse displacements and variations of elastic plates and this point of time it is better to get introduced with the plates in structural analysis or in structures and we generally call a structure plate while the anyone of the dimension is very very thin comp ared to its other two dimension so if we see if we consider a rectangle like this and say if the thickness of this rectangle is very small with respect to its other two dimensions say this is a this is b we call this as a plate and curvature we say it is of an infinite radius of cur vature while it is having some curvature that case we call that structure as a shell so predominantly we have much use of plates and shells in our aircraft structures so this is an important structure in our case and we will see how we will analyze those things slowly so this theory was developed in preliminary form by sophie germain and partly improved upon by sim eon daniel poisson in the year one hundred and eighty-one zero they considered a flat plate as an elasti c plate which resists curvature that means probab ly they try to mean the bending navier gave a definitive development of correct energy expression and governing differential equation a few years later so if you see already we have come acro ss with respect to the energy with resp ect to the variational calculus many names like navier like poisson like that name sophie germain before that we hav e already heard about bernoulli euler and many more s o let u s go further p roblems related to the definition of twisting moment and shear force was finally resolved in one thousand, eight hundred and fifty by german physicist gustav robert kirchhoff kirchhoff also has done many works in relation to plate in some advanced stage we generally say kirchhoff\u2019s plate but those things are much later stage but he first did a distinguish ed work in rela tion to the twisting moment and shear force so the application of virtual work he did and variational calculus procedur es also he established for that in the framework of si mplifying kinematic assumptions fibers initially perpendicular to the plate midd le surface remains so after deformation of that surface this statement has become very famous with respect to kirchhoff and this has led down the analysis of many more bigger structures simplified way of analysis this assumption in your later stage of study you will understand and you will learn the first step in the theory of thin shell was in the year 1770\u2019s by euler a s we have just now got introduced what is the shell and what is the plate the shell is a structure where the third dimension is very small compared to the other two dimensio ns and it is having a curvature also analysis wise shells are also in two different ways it is generally categorized deep shell and shallow cell but we would not go into those details at present so for a thin shell it was first introduced by euler he addressed the deformation of an initially curved beam as an elastic line and provided a simplified analysis of vibration of an elastic bell t his is related to a famous for his analysis of a big charge bell i t was further modified after a long time in the year one thousand, eight hundred and seventy-three by h aaron refer slide time two thousand, seven hundred and fifty-nine acceptable thin shell theories for general situations appropriate for cases of small deformations were developed by a e h love he also did a lot of work f or thin shell formulation and later it got further extended by lamb in one thousand, eight hundred and ninety later many improvements are suggested for thin shell mode lling by w t koiter and novozhilov made the most significant contribution in the year 1950\u2019s with this let us try to c onclude this part of the introduction more elastic general theories in relation to the detail ed description in tensor were form ed by cauchy and then later by poisson by wilhelm leibniz descriptions green described in more detail ed way anisotropy those things may be considered later and it may be noted that it is not much earlier this history ends it is something around one thousand, nine hundred and fifty if we look at this slide the linear elasticity as a general 3dimensional theory was first proposed by cauchy navier and poiss on these term in this sentence line ar elasticity is very important and our discussion will be related to linear elasticity only there is a huge domain of nonlinear elastic ity also we would not go into that g eneral 3dimensional theory this general 3dimensional theory will get introduced in thi s course at some advanced stage maybe in the last few lectures and these things were introduced in the year one thousand, eight hundred and twenty to one thousand, eight hundred and thirty in the isotropic case it predicts that there is only one elastic constant and that the poisson\u2019s ratio has the universal value of onefourth see this is we know now it is not true but at that point of time it got proved and people started believing that and later it was changed and got introduced in a different way now this is relate d to some introduction with the non isotropic material which has a predominant use in aircraft structural analysis in case of laminated composite we have many application related to th at so a maximum possible number of independent elastic moduli in the most general anisotropic solid w as established by george green in one thousand, eight hundred and thirty-seven existence of elastic strain energy required that the thirty-six elastic constants relating the six stress components to the six strains at most twenty-one could be independent s o this is a f amous conclu sion drawn by green thirty-six to twenty-one then we will see later for orthotropic it reduces much more and use considering orthotropic material we can analyze many of the applica tions in the aerospace industry for e xample the composite structures with this history let us conclude todays lecture the first session of the lecture refer slide time three thousand, two hundred and eleven we w ill start fur ther in our forthcoming session but before we finish it it is better to pay our gratitude to these famous scientists i have tabulated with their birth and year and the duration they were on the earth to facilitate human civilization and without their contribution probably we cannot i magine anything under the earth s o it starts with leonardo da vinci and i have noted here as the last person h as w t koiter but it is not that there it ends history is a continuing process and goes further so you may also look at that contribution is not from any one region of the e arth it is from various places like italy france england switzerland fra nce scotland germany and soviet union and netherland also so to show them the gratitude to end with let me name them for on ce leonardo da vinci from italy galileo galilei from italy e mariotte from france robert hooke from england

{"audio_filepath": "/media/rishu/Data1/Code Playground/test_ai4b/wav/10.wav", "duration": 2212.58, "text": "lecture no ten distribution of load on the fuselage welcome back to aircraft structures one course this is professor a nup ghosh from aerospace engin eering department iit kharagpur we are at the tenth lecture today we have already learned the wing moment and shear calculation due to external loads today we will be covering distribution of loads on fuselage present lectu re will cover only how do we need to preprocess we need to prepare the loads properly to find out shear our bending moment in fuselage that we will do refer slide time one hundred and fourteen to do that let us proceed before we proceed as i have mentioned in brief tha t in past class we have done shear and moment and wing of an aircraft and before that loads and other things we have done so with that consideration let us move forward for the fuselage load refer slide time one hundred and forty so distribution of distribution of loads and moments along the fuselage is our aim how the loads come where from what are the components we need to take care and from there how do we distribute it not only distribution it also needs to be rearranged re arrangement of load for analysis refer slide time two hundred and two so before we go for the arrangement earlier two hundred and seven or the fuselage we need to definitely learn a little bit about what exactly we are going to do shear and moment on airplane body that is our aim the body of an airplane act s essentially as a beam so complete aircraft we are considering as a beam and is in some condition of flight or landing as a beam column which maybe also subjected to twisting or torsional forces so it may have some axial force that is why beam column because of acceleration in the forward direction or retardation it may have twist say for a case while two engine craft not the type of aircraft we have considered in our last example or the example what we will solving if it is a two engine aircraft amount ed on wing and because of some reason there is a failure on the failure of one engine that will create huge bending as well as torsional moment not only that because of rolling there could be a torsional moment so to design an airplane body it requires a complete picture of the shearing bending twisting and axial forces which may be encountered in flight or landing so during flight or landing all these shearing bending twisting or axial forces may occur keeping in mind that for 1g consideration or unit load consideration we will try to solve the problem in the load analysis for wings the direct air forces are the major forces for the body load analysis the direct air pressures are secondary so this is a major differences difference between the bei ng load analysis and the body loaded fuselage load analysis direct air pressures are secondary the major forces being of a concentrated nature in the form of loads or reactions from the units attached to the body as the power plant as i just now mentioned the engines w ing landing gear tail etc so all these wings will produce some or the other shear or bending moment on the fuselage in addition since the body usually serves as the load carrying medium important forces are produced on the body in resi sting the inertial forces of the weight of the interior equipment installation payloads etc so it also whatever internal things are there like the equip ment and other installations or payloads that also it needs to carry so that has also to be conside red refer slide time five hundred and thirty design condition and design weight t he airplane body must be designed to withstand all loads f or specified flight conditions for both maneuver and gust conditions since acceleration due to air gusts vary inversely as the ai rplane weight it is customary to analyze or check the body for a flight load condition this why it is inversely unless how the gusts acts we want to spend time on that but let us consider that happens in general the design weights are specified by the gov ern sorry government agencies so this design weights are specified by government agencies as we have discussed the air ordinance agencies are certification agencies they provide the critical conditions and from there we try to put for landing conditions however the normal gross weight is used since it would be more critical than other load conditions and landing condition is a very critical condition of fuselage load analysis for this reason we will see how many landing conditions may exist and we may need to take care the general design conditions which are usually investigated in the design of the body are as follows the general design condition except landing what is generally followed already we have discussed how a wing which section of wing get s most stressed because of high angle of attack positive high angle of attack or negative high angle of attack low angle of attack positive or negative inverted low angle that is the negative one that is why i is there and the inverted high angle of at tack so all the four conditions as we have already considered in case of wing structures that we need also to be considered here but in re al design we need to consider but here in the example we probably you would not do the body is usually equipped sorr y body is usually required to withstand special tail loads both symmetrical and a symmetrical which may be produced by ai r gusts engine forces etc also the body should be checked for forces due to unsymmetrical air loads on the wing so what are the gust engine loads unsymmetrical air loads all these things already we have discussed but to remember to study these are all noted down as a specific case refer slide time eight hundred and twenty-nine landing condition as i told you landing condition is very critical conditi on in landing condition in general the body is investigated airplane body is investigated for the following landing conditions the detailed requirements for each condition are given in the government specification for both military and commercial airplan es so certifying agencies generally give this different certifying agencies for different condition for land planes level landing with side load three point landing with ground loop nose over or turn over condition arresting usually this is not a no rmal condition as it is mentioned it is usually for navy or carrier based airplanes so all these critical cases we are suppose d to consider for during landing and for land planes for seaplanes or boats step landing with and without angular acceleration bow landing stern landing two wave landing beaching conditions catapulting conditions again this is not usual case for special conditions these are landing conditions for special conditions you also need to consider the fuselage or body shear force and mom ent and two of the more most important things are in listed here that is towing of an airplane or jacking and hoisting of aircraft these are required towing is required almost every day for every flight but jacking and hoisting are required for maintenance refer slide time one thousand and twenty-four body weight and balance distribution s o this is where a special group of engineers come in they prepare the body weight and balance distribution let us see how it is prepared and how that uses that is used for the analysis th e resting sorry the resistin g inertia force due to the dead weigh t of the body and it is content plays an important part in the load analysis o f the airplane body so inertia forces and dead weight we need to consider when the initial aerodynamic and th e general layout and arrangement of the airplane i s made it is necessary that a complete weight balance estimate i repeat weight and balance estimate of the airplane is made this estimate which is presented in report form gives the weights and c g locat ions of all major airplane units or installations as well as for m any of the minor units so what ever they are inside all components weight and their cg locations are put in weight and balance estimation sheet which makes up this major airpl ane assemblie s or installations l oad analysis or unit analysis so unless we have the weight balance estimation sheet for a certain aircraft we cannot do that those light weight analysis here and want the moment distribution load analysis unit analysis this already ar e to some extent have got the idea what is unit analysis is due to many design condition such as those listed in the previous discussion the general procedure in the load analysis of an airplane body is to base it on a series of unit analysis so we will see in future classes that we will consider unit analysis in the transverse direction in z direction we will consider unit analysis in the forward direction will also consider unit analysis because of the tail load that is what is mentioned here for different design conditions we need to carry out the unit analysis the loads for any particular design condition then follows as a certain combination of the unit results with the proper multiplying factors so once we have these different load conditions as unit analysis depending upon the particular design criteria we need have a combination of those in unit analysis and we need to find out the final load coming shear force bending moment coming on the fuselage refer slide time one thousand, three hundred and forty-three so our example is this aircraft this is a text book problem we have already solved the wing for bending moment and shear force example problem illustrates the calculation of shear and moments on fuselage due to unit load condition will cover the shear and moment in fu ture class but that starts here that is why it is stated here we will only do in this lecture that distribution and re distribution of the loads coming on the fuselage and how do we need to carry out that for unit load analysis figure below shows a lay out of the airplane body to be used in this example problem it happens to be the body of an actual airplane and the wing used in the previous example problem was the wing that went with the airplane so important things we should notice here that we are considering the reference axis we are con sidering the reference axis five inch forward the tip of the propeller this one we are cons idering the x axis this is the z axis we are cons idering we are considering the x axis here going passing through the center of the propeller the tail height is the tail plane height tip height is about eleven feet two inch and the total length is about twenty-seven width two inch this is the thrust line we are considering cg is little bit below the first line and the wing though we would not be using for this analysis the dimension is given here it is twenty feet and the distance to the landing gear is four hundred and seventy-five inch refer slide time one thousand, five hundred and fifty-four this is what the airpl ane weight and balance sheet is unless we have the airplane weight balance sheet it is di fficult to go forward for the shear and bending moment calculation of fuselage or the airplane body first table gives the weight and balance estimation estimate for the total airplane this table is usually formulated by the weight and balance section as i told you a group of engineering are dedicated for this of the engineering department and it is necessary to have this information before the airplane load analysis can be made so let us try to look at the points what is there in this power plant wei ght is one thousand, one hundred pound before that the vertical z arm measures from the thrust line positive is upwar d horizontal x arms measures f rom z axis five inch forward of prop z axis situated five inch forward of prop center positive is aft that means towards the tail plan e so power plant location is nine inch on x at the thrust line that is why it is zero vertical moment is zero whereas because of it is nineteen inch away the moment about the z axis is simple multiplication of these two quantity we are getting this so this column is n othing but multiplication of these two this column is nothing but multiplication of these two instead of that like considering it that way we may consider it something like that what is the moment produced about the axis we have considered these are the mome nt this is about z axis this is about x axis what are the ot her components there in the weight balance sheet fuselage group wing group tail group surface control electrical system chassis front tail wheel group furnishing radio all these consis t of the empty weight that is why these are summed up here pilot student fuel system here the student is written but it may be consider ed as passenger fuel system and the total gross weight considering the payload and pilot portion payload portion as four three hundred pound and the horizontal moment is coming at three hundred and seventy-six thousand, six hundred and fifteen pound inch whereas the vertical moment what we have that means about the x axis is minus of forty thousand, three hundred and twenty pound inch cg location from easy calculation you can find out the cg location that is eighty-seven fifty-eight in aft of reference axis that means from the tip of the reference axis and in z it is nine hundred and thirty-eight that means below the thrust line tha t is the reason if we go to back or forward we will go because all these things are put on a nice drawing in the ok refer slide ti me one thousand, nine hundred and forty-five this is the drawing of each and every part ok cg is not showed here is the cg so cg is below the x line that is what it is we were discussing so it is there so let us go to the next slide refer slide time one thousand, nine hundred and fifty-nine so in the next slide in th e table we will see some components are not consider for the fuselage or your body shear and moment analysis what are those conditions if you look at it item three seven thirteen are not there what are the items item three wing group is not considered item seven chassis fr ont is not considered item thirteen fuel system is not considered so wing group if we go further back wing group is actually this portion this is the fuel inside and what is the other one and the fuel fuel inside chassis front and wing group consisting of the portion as we have shown so these three items are not considered as the load carried by the fuselage why will because we assume that in practical co nsideration we see that load is directly carried by the landing gear not the fuselage so that is the rea son it would not come for the fuselage load analysis so this table is further prepared for that and we have re return those parameters we have calculated the cg again considering gross weight as well as only empty weight so both cg we see that it is eighty-six two while there is a change because of the payload that change and the fuel bond need to be adjusted during flight that is a different consideration of flight mechanics we would not discuss much about that but in the z direction there is not much change bu t we also need to consider that during f light so weight and balance of body items weight distribution we are continuing second table gives the weight and balance calculation for all items attached to the fuselage or carried in the fuselage except the w ing group and items attached to the wing as the front landing gear and the fuel refer slide time two thousand, three hundred and thirty-two so here all those items are shown with plus sign as item number one two three is missing four is here five is here six is here like that all the items whatever listed i the word balance shape those things whatever required for fuselage load analysis that is even shown here for a close approximation of the shear and moments where moments weights of the various items as given in the table is distributed the figu re shows a side view of the airplane with the center of gravity locations of the weights weight items of the second table indicated by plus signs in the various design conditions the directions of the weight inertia force changes thus it is convenient an d customary to resolve the inertial forces into x and z components so from these point we will go for the resolving the forces in x and z components so this is for vertical z component weight items of table acting in z direction in this figure the weig hts as given in the second table are assumed acting in the z direction through their cg location the loads as shown would not give a true picture as to the shears and moments along the fuselage thus these leads loads sorry these loads should be distribut ed in a manner which should simulate the actual weight distribution so this is important which should simulate the actual weight distribution particularly these three hundred and fifty load the fuselage load we will see we will come to that point in most weight and balanc e reports the weight items are broken down into considerable more detail than that shown in the second table which makes the weight distribution more evident so if it is given in the weight balance table we need to use that otherwise the weight is given w e will have to use it the study of inward profile drawing of the airplane which shows the general arrangement of all the installations and equipment is required so that study we need to do unless we have the profile drawing it is difficult to distribut e those loads furthermore the overall structural arrangement and its possible influence on fuselage weight distribution to be considered so depending on the structural arrangement we need to distribute the fuselage weight that is most important and we nee d to carry that thing we need to do that thing refer slide time two thousand, five hundred and fifty-six in order to obtain reasonable accuracy the fuselage or body is divided into a series of stations or sections better we go back these are the stations zero eleven fifty-five eighty-eight one hundred and twenty like that t hese stations are generally divided and depending on the stations we need to carry out the load analysis in this figure the sections selected are designed as station \u2019s which represents the distance fro m the z reference axis the general problem is to dist ribute the concentrated loads as shown in the second figure into an equivalent system acting at the various fuselage station points this is the most important point in our discussion today so we need to distribute the concentrated loads as shown in the second figure into an equivalent system acting at the various fuselage station points a we ight item from the second table represents a concentrated load such as a pilot student radio etc the weight can be distributed to adjacent station points inve rsely as the distance of the weight from these adjacent stations a weight item such as the fuselage structure item two of the second table whose cg location causes it to fall between stations eighty and one hundred and twenty of the second figure it would obviously be wrong to distribute this weight only to the two adjac ent stations since the weight three hundred and fifty pound is for the entire fuselage so we need to distribute this three hundred and fifty pound along the length of the fuselage such that it represents for properly in those stations the fuselage weig hts these weight items of three hundred and fifty pounds should thus be distributed to all station points the controlling requirement on this distribution is that the moment of the distributed system about the reference access must be equal to the moment of the original w eight about the same axis the third figure shows how the dead weight of the three hundred and fifty pound was distributed to the various station points considering the weights to be acting in the z direction refer slide time two thousand, eight hundred and thirty-nine let see the controlling requirement on this distribution is that the moment this already we have read so i am not going to read again thus for reference to this slide it is put down there the third figure shows how the dead weight of this how the dead weight is distributed all this mainly th e three hundred and fifty load this load is distributed at station eleven as nineteen pound eighty pound seventy-eight sixty-five all this way this has been done this is the iterative process not only iterative process this also requires a concept as well as drawing of similar aircraft for this distributi on otherwise it will be very difficult to distribute the loads pleas look at the distribution this region is the highest load concentration because this region is the most load bearing section of the fuselage and other section the load are not much those sections may carry a small amount of load and required loads whatever coming on the fuselage so depending on that concept it is not a easy task it cannot be distributed the way the this criteria match it is not only depending on this criteria it is a lso dependent on the practical consideration and experience of an engineer how to distribute the load refer sli de time three thousand and thirteen this is a table to carry out that distribution as i mention it is iterative process that iterative process is difficult to so lve people used to do it with big charts and slide rules and calculator previously but now it is people have the facility of the computer and it is generally tried using computer to distribute the load this table is a very important table in our today \u2019s discussion if you look at the previous two three slide discussi on that two three slides discussion is completely given here in this row whatever is given so it is it look like a simple row but it is the result of the all calculations and experience what is given that nineteen load if we take for example is at station eleven from the horizontal direction at x axis but it is also upward one inch from the thrust line t he other part eighty that is below four inch the thrust line so it is not only that in only with respective to the z axis the equilibrium is considered it is also that it is about the x axis also the equilibrium is considered and if we look at the other all distributions this is twenty thousand, nine hundred and fourteen is coming from the power plant the horizontal moment and we are summing up all th is horizontal moment to this value and if we sum up these horizontal moment also this will give us this value how do we get this horizontal moment weight at stat ion is the addition of these two and that is multiplied by this eleven gives us the horizontal momen t here so from the both sides we get the sum mation equal and we have the similarly the vertical moment if we look at here this is multiply by zero but nineteen is multiplied by one that is the reaso n it is having the value of nineteen a nd similarly the vertical moments sums up to this five thousand, nine hundred and twenty if you carry out this in a excel sheet you can easily select this row and check that this is summing to this five thousand, nine hundred and twenty that could be a small error with respe ct to the previous table what we have seen but those errors are neglected to e stimate the overall moment overall distribution of the weights along the z and x axis bu t this table shows the results of this station point where distribution for the weight items of the second table the values in the horizontal rows opposite each weight items show the distribution to the various fuselage station the summation of the weights in each vertical column at each station point as given in the thi rd horizontal row from the bottom of the table gives the final station point weig ht final weight distribution to station refer slide time three thousand, three hundred and fifty-three so this is what were from do we get this let us go back eight hundred and ninety-three three hundred and eighty-eight three hundred and seven four hundred and seven eight hundred and ninety-three three hundred and eighty-eight three hundred and seven four hundred and seven and four hundred and nine as i told you there could be a small mismatch between this figure and the calculation one so please ignore that it is close three hundred and eleven seventy-six ten twenty-one three hundred and eleven seventy-six ten twenty-one one hundred and eighteen and twenty-two so all these are shown here the redistributed loads combine with all other internal as well as fuselage load and with this load distribution only we will carry out our shear force bendin g moment calculation these weight s are shown in the fourth figure acting in the z direction the moment of each total station loads about z axis is given in the second horizontal row from the bottom of the third table that means the previous table the summation of the moments in this row must equal to the total wx moment of the second table or two hundred and nineteen thousand, eight hundred and forty-three pounds inch or inch pound this check is shown in the last vertical column of the third table refer slide time three thousand, five hundred and twenty-six ok this is we have concepts in ho w it is distributed in in the vertical direction this figure shows in the horizontal way how it is distributed eighty is acting here this is the mistake the corresponding values is not put there yo u may please refer to the table sixty-five is acting above the x lin e fifty-two is acting above the x line and similar way on the x direction where the loads are acting all those things are shown here and the fuselage weight distribution to the x axis plus couple so because of this distance a couple will be created that coup le is shown here eighty and three hundred and twenty is the couple eighty is the force two hundred and thirty-four is the couple and i think this is one hundred and thirty is the load here here the sixty-five is the load and five hundred and twenty is the couple and finally the final weight distribution in x direction refer to x axis plus proper coupl es gives us this figure refer slide time three thousand, six hundred and forty-five and with this we will end today \u2019s this lecture and what we have learnt is that with respect to the vertical z axis as well as x axis how the loads and moments are distributed to distribute the loads comin g in the fuselage that has been discussed here and along with that we will thank you for attending this lec ture we will meet again with in the next lecture thank you"}

anup ghosh from aerospace engineeri ng department iit kharagpur this is the last lecture of second week lecture eleven unit load analysis of fuselage refer slide time zero fifty in the last lecture we have we have completed the load distribution and this lecture will continue from there be fore that as it is just now i have mentioned we have learned what we have learned that as a quick recapitulation you can say we have learned some history from solid mechanics view or structural analysis view to the development of aircraft conceptual deta il of aircraft how big small variation of wing positions all those we have done flight envelope please excuse me for that flight envelope and load factors for various status and then loads from symmetric maneuver of any aircraft so these load factor how does it vary where that is very important part how does it where you where it is taking which value those things we have discussed then on an aircraft we have considered the wing load and then using the wing load we have found out the bending mome nt shear force acting on the wing and then in the last class we have started the fuselage bending moment shear force diagram and bending moment shear force analysis but since fuselage is a different type of structure than wing and it causes of different other category loads including loads coming from its own weight the fuselage weight that we have seen that how that own weight is distributed throughout the length of the fuselage and how that balance is maintained about an axis z axis the vertical axis or the first line axis or about the x axis then accordingly we have distributed the fuselage weight total weight that is distributed along the length x as well as along the length z so maintaining the total moment of that so with that concept we have already come across a table and that table shows us the final distribution of the loads it is not only the loads coming from the fuselage it is also the loads coming from other payloads like the pilot like other radio equipments say or other passengers w hoever it is those things are distributed on the fuselage various station points like the wing analysis here also we have considered station points and windows station points how it gets converted as a concentrated load or a moment that we have seen in ou r last lecture with figures with good explanation in the figures and for any kind of clarification i would suggest carefully you look at the figure and the description you will come to know how it is where it is refer slide time zero four hundred and thirteen so with that load we will start today unit load analysis we will start today unit load analysis for fuselage will consider three load conditions loads in vertical direction loads in horizontal direction loads from tail plane so in each and every case as a unit load analysis will be considering unit acceleration and then we will continue our study refer slide time zero four hundred and forty-nine so following that same line the unit analysis of fuselage shears and moments since there are many flight and landing conditions considerable time can be saved if a unit analysis is made for the fuselage shears shears and bending forces this is actually the purpose of unit analysis we have already discussed it is a repeat no problem in that i guess the design values in general then follow as a summation of the values in the unit analysis times a proper multiplication factor that means if the direction z is more that many times you need to multiply it with it and then you will have to add it the loads on the fuselage in general consists of t ail loads engine loads wing reactions landing gear reactions if attached to fuselage and inertia forces due to the airplane acceleration which may be due to do both translational angular acceleration of the airplane for simplicity these loads can be re solved into components parallel to z and x axis that we have already resolved in our previous class we will continue solving that same problem to illustrate the unit analysis procedure a unit analysis for our example problem will be carried out for the f ollowing in condition unit acceleration or load factor in z direction as i mentioned already unit acceleration or load factor in x direction unit tail load normal to xaxis acting downward so these three conditions will be conspire we will be solving toda y let u s see how do we proceed in the first case refer slide time zero six hundred and fifty-seven solution for unit load factor in z direction figure shows the deadweight loads acting in the z direction as taken from table this values it is talking about all these values eight hundred and ninety-three pound at station eleven three hundred and eighty-eight pound at station fifty three hundred and seven pound at station eighty one hundred and twenty at station one hundred and twenty four hundred and seven at station one hundred and seventy three hundred and eleven at station two hundred one hundred and seventy-six pound at two hundred and thirty station two hundred and thirty it is ten pound two hundred and sixty twenty-one pound at station two hundred and ninety it is one hundred and eighteen pound at station three hundred and fifteen it is twenty-two pound the wing is attached to the fuselage a t station seventy-three and one hundred and sixteen as shown so here the wing is attached the fittings at these points are assumed as designed to cause all the drag or reaction in the x direction to be taken off entirely at the front fitting of seventy-three at station seventy-three let us repeat the fittings at this point are assumed as designed to cause all the drag or reaction in the x direction to taken off entirely at the front fitting that means whatever coming the horizontal force that is taken by this one at s tation seventy-three that is what is mentioned here let us try to find out the reaction components at the wing fitting to place the fuselage in equilibrium the wing r eaction will be calculated that i s the weighing reaction is a very small easy calculation we need to do summation of x equals to zero that is r h gives us the r h equals to zero summation of mo about point o about this point it is zero and this has to be subscript and that we considered a two nineteen thousand, seven hundred and seventy-five one hundred and sixteen or this one hundred and sixteen this dat a one hundred and sixteen is coming from the distance here i t is seventy-three station seventy-three and this is station one hundred and sixteen this o is about this point that is the reason one hundred and sixteen is coming here and seventy-three is also coming there so that gives us one equation the other z because two in vertical direction if we consider equals to zero that gives us the moment sorry that gives us two hundred and fifty-five plus this is from the table this is also from the table the total moment and then r f and r r this total moment we know that is the reason the movement is considered about this point about o and then it is it goes to zero and then we solve these two equations and we get that r f is equal to one thousand, seven hundred and eighty r r equals to seven hundred and seventy-five pound here i would like to mention that because calculations may not match exactly digit by digit because in the table if you look at there because of the rearrangement of the loads there are small changes and to accommodate those small changes sometimes the digit may not match digit by digits results may not match digit by digit refer slide time one thousand, one hundred and nineteen so what we are doing in the next slide in the next slide we are doing we are bringing in those stations and the left side column and on that station what do we bring at three fifteen this is that when load twenty-two twenty-two before why it is twenty-two let us have a value of reaction is approximated for a value of seventy-seven this is this n ote will come need later we will do i t this is with relation to this s o minus is because we are considering z up up on lift and down on right side of a section is positive shear this is please ignore this z a positive shear actually this is z axis tha t jade has come here please consider this as a z axis that mistake and then tension in upper fuselage portion is negative bending moment positive refers to the half side of station negative side refers to forward side of station so m is equals to m star this one at previous section this column we are talking about at previous station in column six plus the incremental moment of column five it is talking about m star is this column so this is this loads all are considered negative because it is coming down o nly if we look at that r f one thousand, seven hundred and eighty and seven hundred and seventy-five at one hundred and sixteen station at and at seventy-three station where wings are at us those are on the acting vertically upward so all those loads are put in this column then the shear shear between these two is definitely the twenty-two and between these two it is increases on the left of twenty-nine to ninety station here it will come this plus this is coming here and that gives us one hundred and forty and if we go across after the two hundred and sixty definitely these three gets added up so after two hundred and sixty sorry after two hundred and sixty so that gets added up and that becomes one hundred one hundred and sixty-one this plus this plus this so accordingly we add it and we find it that immediately after 50th station fifty if we look at immediately after station fifty it is three hundred and eighty-eight because this is acting upward these two are acting upward and here it is sor ry i should say here at station seventy-three you see it changes sign at station seventy-three what is happening this one seven eight zero is acting upward thats get added up and then it is on the other direction this sign convention is described here as we have said up on t he left and down on the right side of the section is positive shear following that this sign convention is given distance to the next station this is simply a subtraction of these two point this is twenty-five and definitely moment we are getting from there this m ultiplied by this we are getting this value this multiplied by this we are getting this value and this multiplied by this we are getting this value what is happening here the moment is equals to this twenty-two multiplied by the difference between this station h ere it comes that moment but again the other moment is this concentrated force multiplied by this distance this distance is multiplied by this and that gives us this value this this while get multiplied gives this value and similarly if we look at other points also we get the moments accordingly and that gets increased increases the value depends on the on the shear acting and the distance between those and what we get on the on the sixth column this is fifth column on the sixth column what do we get w e get it added that means the moment produced here that plus the moment produced by these two is getting added so that is the reason this plus this is this value and then this plus this is getting this value and accordingly we are getting the moment on t he fuselage so if this moments will have got and we plot it i have again used some spreadsheet utility to plot it it is not advisable to plot with spreadsheet you may use some other utility since it is negative in sign that that is not it has plotted o n the bottom side so it is showing that it at the free ends this is also free and this is also free end that moment zero is maintained and the first line as i was telling you that seven hundred and seventy-five thousand and twenty-eight it makes this value zero but we have considered here is that if this is seven hundred and seventy-five this value is seven hundred and seventy-five but if you look at the table third table in the previous lecture you will see that we have made adjustment while we have iterated values and distributed these loads that these loads have has a little bit adjustment and that may inc rease or decrease little bit in the reaction force being reaction force and considering those things it may be considered that this is also a negligible value or zero value and then following that the moment on the fuselage in the vertical direction unit lo ad in the vertical direction takes this type of form so the second part we are will have come across so i would like to go back once to as we were discussing it is better to note that this are f and r r this to this is say because of z direction unit lo ad and what we will get later is that that for x direction unit load as well as for unit load at tail assembly tail plane so we need to add these three while all the three are acting together to give you that concept but i am just trying to differentiat e it with r f and r r because later it will be difficult to come back and see it refer slide time one thousand, nine hundred and twenty-three so we have come to the x direction for solution of unit load factor in x direction this is again taken from that same table where load distribut ion is considered and the moments are shown here what do we do in this similar way as we have done in the last case we need to find out the values of r f and r r figure shows the panel point dead weight distribution for loads acting in x direction at di fferent station it is acting in the x direction in association to moments and as taken from the table to place the fuselage in equilibrium the wing reaction at point a and b will be calculated this is point a and b as we have done in the last case here a lso we will do and solving that what the forward as mentioned in the previous and assumption that r h is equal to two thousand, five hundred and fifty-five pound this horizontal force it is balancing all the force in the this direction and the vertical two forces r f and r r again it is bett er to mention that these two are this r r is because of x and this r f is because of x so better to note these two that this is not to confuse with the previous case while both say for z and x both unit load is acting then we need to add up these two and all other moments also so let us go forward this equations i am not describing again because these are simple moment equations about a the moment is considered here and all those things are quite easy you can easily get if you look at it carefully refer slide time one thousand, nine hundred and twenty-three and this table also is there is not much things to explain because already we have explained one table only difference is that here we have one more moment component that we need to see moment increase due to axial load moment increment due to vertical shear moment at the left of station so two things we are we have this vertical shear we are well we are talking about these two you say all other components are zero only this component and this component is having some value and t hat is because of this shear excitation seventy-three this is acting this one vertical z shear this is acting with a x axis distance of thirty-six these two gets multiplied and we get this value similarly this two gets multiplied and we get this value so the vertical shea r these two values we have got from their r f and r r are equal values we have so that is the reason we have these two is here and these two getting multiplied and having this value and this is as we have seen this is addition of this plus this plus thi s and we are getting this value and this is this plus this plus this and we are getting this value so the other things are similar if we follow carefully a similar way we have put the loads in x direction and we have put the load in the z direction as it is mentioned the reactions we have at one hundred and sixteen station and at seventy-three station and because of that there is a shear force in some in the z direction in the x direction also axial load increases that gives us this moment component this moment component we get from this two is getting this moment component this two is getting this two hundred and twenty is this is the two hundred and twenty moment this is the direct moment we are getting that moment is added up this two hundred and twenty is added up with this to two thousand, two hundred and forty-nine these components are from directly from there two hundred and seventy-four thi s is x component moments are plotted from the station whatever we have from the station it is plotted here and this is the for the vertical shear it is getting multiplied this way we are getting this value this moments as we have already found out from there we have put it so accordingly we get the moment on the fuselage because of the x unit load and we plot that x in net load and the bending moment diagram is something like this here we have a negative bending moment up to this station and then again we have a sharp increase in the opposite direction because of these two shear forces through wing reactions and then it goes down from here almost zero it goes you see nineteen twenty two thousand, seven hundred and nineteen these are very small values and from there it is zero so for the x directio n load it is almost clear how do we carry out the analysis and if we move forward refer slide time two thousand, six hundred and three this is for the unit tail plane solution for unit horizontal tail load acting downward two thousand, seven hundred and fifty-five is the station value that i s there is in one hundred two hundred and seventy-seven seventy-three this about this point when the moment is considered as the reason this is the station point value how far it is from this section and load is one hundred the fuselage shears and moments will be computed for a unit even a tail load of one hundred pound here the unit loa d is considered as one hundred pound on the tail acting in z direction with balancing reactions at the wing attachment points the center of pressure on the horizontal tail is at station two thousand, seven hundred and seventy-five figure shows the fuselage length loading to find wing reactions at a and b so if we see it is a simple equation solving with respect to point a the moment acting this way is considered and with forty-three r because the distance between these two stations are forty-three it is acting the other way that is the reason it is considered like tha t and accordingly we get the r r value r r value as four thousand, seven hundred and fifty-six pound upward and summation of loads in the z direction gives us that the r f value is three thousand, seven hundred and fifty-six pound again it is better to mention that this is because of the tail plane load and while all the three loads are acting we need to sum it up with proportion depending on how much load is acting in which direction here whether the tail plane load is more than one hundred if it is two hundred we need to multiply it by two even the moments also we need to multiply it by two if the acceleration in x direction is 2z and then we need to multiply it by two and if in a vertical direction it is 3z we need to multiply all the components by three refer slide time two thousand, eight hundred and twenty-one so we come to the table as usual table table does not have much mor e difference between the previous and this so i wo uld not spend much time you please look at it with your spare time how is it done all these station points the shear forces load reactions are given there then shear forces as it is it is in starting from here and that remains constant that remains constant from this point up to this point because there is no other load at one hundred and sixteen that the shear force from the wing reaction coming and from the wing reaction we get this value and again the other is there and t hat we get this value okay this gets balanced here becomes shear force becomes zero because of this this remains constant in this section from here to here and then becomes zero and moments as we have seen already accordingly moment is calculated this multipli ed by this is this one because this is the distance between the station points and this is the shear force acting and accordingly as we have done in previous tables this is this plus this is this this plus this is this and accordingly we continue findin g out moments again there is some amount of movement that is because of the approximation we have already carried out and this gives us a straight line as it is expected so with this we have we have covered the unit load analysis of a whole aircraft we h ave covered previous to previous in the previous to previous lecture the bending moment and shear force experienced by cantilever wing and then in the last lecture we have covered how the loads should be distributed that is very very important we have s een how loads should be found out by the experienced engineer and then we have seen how that load must be distributed at station points of a fuselage to keep the moment balance and then in this lecture what we have learnt we have learnt that how in for three different cases we can continue we can carry out the unit load analysis in z direction per unit acceleration in x direction per unit acceleration and for tail plane load horizontal tail plane load of one hundred pound we have carried out the unit load analysis but it is the it is it is not a case that only one of the unit load acts on the aircraft at a time it is a combination of all those things so we are supposed to add up all those things considering linear combination of the cases and we can find out the combined bending moment shear force diagram in all these cases in case of wing structure wing as well as in fuselage i have concentrated mostly on the bending moment diagram as an home assignment what you can do you can easily draw the shear force diagr am and check with your diagram and the values whether it is matching properly or not the basic shear force diagram properties are satisfied or not and accordingly you may continue your home assignment refer slide time three thousand, two hundred and three so with this we go forward for the reference light in different slides remain same because it is all the books generally considered refer slide time three thousand, two hundred and nine and this slight conclusion already i have told you just to note it down you please keep a note what are the points we h ave learnt today and with that i thank you for attending this lecture we will meet again in our next lecture"}

from aerospace engineering departme nt iit kharagpur we are at the beginning of week three lectures lecture number twelve truss system will get introduced to truss system we will see how determinate truss is and predominantly in concentrate in these weekly lectures with determinate truss plane t russ as well as space truss space truss is our three dimensional stress is more popular in aircraft structures but to get introduced we will spend some time in truss structures plane stress structures and then we will proceed further refer slide time zero one hundred and nine so as we have seen this is history of aircraft engineering we have seen we have in the last week what we have seen is mentioned at the bottom the shear and moment on fuselage and shear and moment on wing refer slide time zero one hundred and twenty-seven also we have s een so with that we will get introduced this week with two the truss system method of section refer slide time zero one hundred and thirty-five so what we do a truss system statically determinate and indeterminate structures in this terminology determinate and indeterminat e structures this is very frequent in case of truss structures so it is easy to determine which is determinate which is not inter determinate or indeterminate a system is said to be determinate in all external if all the external reactions and internal loads on its members can be obtained utilizing only the static equations of equilibrium see here we mention internally and externally internal loads and external reactions otherwise the structure is said to be statically indeterminate or as redundant s tructures in case of planes truss we usually have three equations equi librium equation that i s the reason and number of unknowns are in so total number of unknowns are m three and we have number of equations as number joints multiplied by two if it is less than that it is unstable plane truss we say if it is more equal then it is statically determinant plane truss internally we say internally because if the number of reaction is more than it is externally indeterminacy it is three if it is internal indetermina cy so if it is more it is indeterminate plane truss so the three equations of equilibrium as we have seen many of you are already introduced so we are not going to spend much time on it if you are interested about it please refer to many mechanics boo ks many books are available to show it similarly for space truss the number of equations has six as it is described at the bottom three equations of force and three equations of moments and similar way it is internally determinate it is indeterminate and if it is less than it is unstable that means the truss is not supposed to be our load it is to collapse refer slide time zero four hundred and three so it is always desirable to study a truss structure with example method of joints type of we will study this week two examples who will do this is one example its a very famous example we have a consider the requirement are to be found out is internal loads internal loads acting on each member of the structure shown in the figure so somehow there are loads t equals to this is acting one hundred pound is acting on it this is freely rotating disc attached at the end of the this horizontal bar ch and there is one more system which is supported here and one more link bar is there that is say that another two force member is there what is to force member also we will see refer slide time zero five hundred and ten so fast disassemble the structure as shown we have disassembled it or in more better way we say it is a free body diagram they make a free body diagram for each member since member one two and four six this is four six this is one two are two force members the forces acting on them are along the line joining the pin joints of the member s since these members are only joined at the two ends and there is no other force in between this if we are able to find out one it is a two force member so if one is known the other is automatically known so that that is the way the free body diagram is shown here and that way it reduces to three reaction this one this one and this one so we need to find out external reactions and also we need to find out the internal loads developed in the member all directions of forces are chosen arbitrarily and most must be reversed if a negative value is obtained that is 3xf is assumed to act to the right on th e horizontal member this way and this way and therefore must act to the l eft since its magnitude to be negative so this will come later so we will see if it is required we may need to reverse or considering the same direction putting the negative value we can easily solve that problem so all the forces here two components are there from this point as it is you see 7xf is acting this way here the other way it is acting here 7xf 7yf is acting this way upward it is acting downward here and at this po int similar way 3xf is acting this way there i s a reason it is acting this way we are assuming all these joints are pin joints that means the it is free to rotate and it can have since there here we have two components it has two components here only we have one component that is why it is two force member here also only one member that i s why it is a two force member refer slide time zero seven hundred and fifty so we have a consider the free body diagram for solving from one side that is the general approach of sol ving with method of joints what we have done we have separated out the disc and let u s see from one to other equation how do we solve the problem for the pulley summation of moment we have considered about this point clockwise is considered positive dimensions are not given here also this is the two two feet three three feet four feet and these are also in feet changing so that is the reason to was comin g there and while what we see that one thousand multiplied by two is equals to minus of 2t again two multiplied by so tension in the cable is one thousand pound you will consider summation in x direction we get the 7xf this equation i guess it i s a typographical mistake i h ope you will get it 7xf one thousand is equals to zero if i cut this then 7xf one thousand is equals to zero here similar way we get there 7yf the component in y direction is equals to one thousand so once we know this we will take these forces here and we wi ll go on solving the o ther components refer slide time one thousand and ten so that i s the reason the free body diagram has come in this slide so in this slide as we have considered that two force member 6f is acting here in this direction but one thing we need to know is about the angle that is solved here tan inverse three by four is equals to three hundred and sixty-nine degree this three by four is from the geometry is already in taken so first to consider moment about three about this point we are considering moment and this twenty-four is already calculated the distance b etween this length so one thousand is seven is this distance is seven and then this is passing through this point these two are also passing through this point so the no component of these three forces are coming only 7yf acting downward this is acting this way the perpend icular distance is twenty-four and accordingly if we solve the equation we get the 6f equals to two thousand, nine hundred and fifteen pound so similarly if we consider the equilibrium equation in the x direction this two thousand, nine hundred and fifteen pound of 6f whatever we have got that cost component of this this is the angle whatever we have found out if 3xf this direction plus this is also acting in this direction minus this 7xf this one thousand is considered so this gives us the equilibrium equation in the x direction and we get that 3xf value ad as minus one thousand, three hundred and thirty-five this is wh at was mentioned in the first slide it is negative so either we may continue solving considering the arrow otherwise other direction or with the help considering this as a negative force keeping the direction same we can continue solving it in the y di rection similarly if we get the sine component will come of the same force and we get the vertical d irection force as 3yf is equals to minus seven hundred and fifty pound since the magnitude of 3xf and 3yf comes to be negative the assumed direction must be revised a common practice is to cross out rather than erase the original arrow this is that i s what we i mentioned just now we may keep the arrow same with keeping the force in the other direction or we can change the arrow refer slide time one thousand, three hundred and fifteen so if we come here in the next vertical member forces equilibrium of that process this 6f 4f and 6f are same since there are two joints that i s why at two points this is named in this way so 3xf you see is considered in the same direction so we are supposed to put the n egative value so we are considering moment about five this point so what are the forces will come this forces are known this force is known this is the force only unknown forces this 2f again this 2f here it is written 1f actually this 1f and 2f are same because it is a two force member so it may be written either as 2f or it may be written as 1f so from there considering that same equation what do we get is that if 1f is equals to five hundred pound now considering the summation of forces in the horiz ontal directions please keep in and keep it in mind in our drawing it was mentioned that this angle is thirty degree and the other angle if we complete this this angle is sixty degree so considering the x direction force equilibrium what we are going to get is that a 5xf the reaction here we write the equation this way a 5xf two thousand, nine hundred and fifteen cos three hundred and sixty-nine one thousand, three hundred and thirty-five five hundred cos sixty zero so see this is positive though it is on the other direction positive is put because of the negative force found and accordingly we get the va lue of the five reaction one of the reaction 5xf which is one thousand, two hundred and fifty power similarly if we consider the equilibrium in the y direction same manner the sine component comes and sine component of this force comes and the seven people the other two forces components of what are coming and we get the value of 5yf is goes to one thousand, four hundred and thirty-three pound as i was made i have mentioned previously now you see th at this is to force member that i s why 1f is equals to 2f 4fis equals to 6f now all internal loads have been obtained wi thout the use of inter nal structure as a free body the solution is checked by applying the three equations of equilibrium to the int ernal structure so considering the entire structure as a whole these three reactions can be found out so that is what is done it is said that instead of finding out the equilibrium equations for the whole structure is found its calculated and it sums up to equals to zero in the y direction also if we consider this also comes as zero and if we consider a moment about this point that also comes as equals to zero the equilibrium check should be made wherever possible to detect any error that might have occurred during the analysis so this is a simplified very simple example to get introduced with the method of joints sorry yes met hod of joints the next example what we will be solving is a introduction to the method of section refer slide time one thousand, seven hundred and forty-six so and let us see how do we solve this is one example this all these are liquid spaced ten inch distance this is a truss membe r all these joints are pin joints we always assume sometimes we show sometimes we do not show so this is pin joint that i s why there are two rea ctions this is roller join that i s why there is only one reaction this is acting upward and we need to find o ut member forces you please keep it in mind these small scripts are the right numbers one two three four five six seven and this big font number whatever is there this one these are the member number this number is one two three four five six seven eight nine ten and eleven this is even ten inch there is a horizontal force acting here on this joint two hundred pound two thousand pound one vertically downward force is acting here at joint two as for four thousand pound and a t joint seven there is a there is a load acting as one thousand pound what we need to find out w e need to find out member force this find the internal load in the member five of the coplanar truss structure shown so that i s what we have already discussed that we will be solving mainly the plane trusses or the coplanar truss structures which does not have any other any member away from the plane of the other members so considering that we will solve this problem refer slide time one thousand, nine hundred and forty-four method of sections as it is said here as in this example often it is desirable to find the internal loads i n cer tain selected members that i s why the method of section is more popular while we do not need to find out all the member forces in those situations method of method of session is much more popular of a truss without analyzing the entire truss usually the method of joints is cumbersome in this case since the loads in all the members to the left or right of any member must be obtained before the force is found in that particular member in method of joints if we follow we need to need to find out all the m ember forces previous to the member forc e what we want to find out that i s the reason this is more popular an analysis by the method of section will yield the internal load in any pre selected member by single operation without the necessity of finding l oads in the other members instead of considering the joints as free bodies a cross section is taken through the truss and the part of the truss on there on either side is considered as free body so this is the key we need to choose a section that secti on is not a desirably a straight line it can have can be a curved section also but the either side as a free body this is free body considered as a free body the cross section is chosen so that it cuts the member for which the forces are desired and pre ferably only three members are cut so this is a trick to cut only three members but many times it is not possible to do and such examples if time permits we will follow refer slide time two thousand, one hundred and fifty-six so the truss section what we have considered here is th is one as it is said preferably three members to cut that is what is cut here if we look at this member this member and this member are cut and what we have we have we need to find out the external forces before we come to the method of section finding o ut external forces we need to solve the equation that you may do as a homework or maybe why we will be solving the same problem using method of joints there you can you can learn how to find out the forces considering the whole structure as a free body and then considering moment about this point if we consider then we can easily find out this vertical force and the other way if we consider the other two equations once this is known if we consider equilibrium in the vertical direction that will give us this reaction force if we consider equilibrium in the horizontal direction that will give us this reaction force so once we come to know these reaction forces we can easily apply the method of section and continue in our example t he internal load in th e member five is desired the free body is as shown the load is load in member five they may be found by summing forces in y direction on either part of the cut truss considering the left side as ev erybody we get so this side is considered we are considerin g the equilibrium in the vertical direction so if we consider this way the unknown force this is acting in this direction this is acting in this direction so if we are considering this equilibrium what we get is that these two are horizontal components so if we simply consider the equilibrium in the vertical direction the y direction that gives us as the solution 5f is equals to five hundred pound so it is that easy to find out using method of section but in our next lecture we will see how difficult how ti meconsuming it is to find out using method of joints but method we need to learn both the fast process to do because we some these method of sections sometimes is not very good in case of three dimensional truss having a section in three dimensional truss is v ery very difficult and in those cases method of joint more useful and we need to follow this that method of joints more vivid way and we that will be covered in our next lecture refer slide time two thousand, five hundred so with this consideration let us end todays lecture and with this lecture there are standard references what we have already seen earlier also applied elasticity by one analysis of your cuff structure and introduction by donaldson analysis of design a flight structure by bruhn by ravello theory theory analysis of flight structure the aircraft structure for engineering student might mention peery and azar aircraft structure wesley peery and azar aircraft structure but amongst these books the most popular and most useful books are this bruhn this megson this peery and sometimes we have also considered this bruhn later classes we will consider donaldson also you have used to some extent and any book of aircraft structure is always useful for learning refer slide time two thousand, six hundred and three so what we have done in this with more stress is the method of section and we have seen that we if we choose a section in a very wise manner with experience we can easily find out any member force without much difficulty without much effort putting on it so this is a v ery intelligent way of finding out but it requires experience to do so with this lecture thank you for attending this lecture and we end todays lecture you please come back in our next class with method of more detail of method of truss thank you"}

anup ghosh from aerospace engine ering department iit kharagpur we are in the third week of the series so we have you are already introduced with the truss system system you are basically introduced with the plane truss system and a small example two small examples we have done in our last lecture in that in the first example we have seen how the overall equilibrium to consider to find out forces and from separating the members how to prepare the free body diagram and then to continue for the solution of the total problem then we h ave already also learned the method of sections which is a very easy and efficient way of finding out a particular member force but that requires some experience unless you are you have solved some problems it is difficult to use that method with that fou ndation of plane truss we will move forward for solution of plane truss or similar problem this in this lecture and in forthcoming lecture we will move forward to three dimensional or space structures sometimes space truss mainly will solve space truss but this week this lecture this lecture particularly will consider method of joints refer slide time zero two hundred and nineteen and in this wheels let u s see how do we solve but before that like every other lecture starting we would like to revisit what we have done alr eady we have seen where from the solid mechanics or structural analysis has started and where we are at present we have seen how the aircraft has progressed and come to a huge aircraft from a small one from there we have come to loads coming on the aircr aft we have learned about flight envelope we have learned about load factor shear and moment on wing of an aircraft we have solved how to find out shear and moment on wing how to solve for shear and moment in coming experienced by a fuselage that is als o solved and then as just now we have talked about introduction to method of sections we have covered and to some extent introduction to truss structures have been covered in the last lecture refer slide time zero three hundred and thirty-six this week the same stress system all you will be doing but method of joints with stress on the method of joints refer slide time zero three hundred and forty-four method of joints if we look at in this anal ysis of our truss by method of joints the two equations of static equilibrium that is horizontal forces are \u2211f x zero \u2192 and vertical forces \u2211f y zero up are applied for each joint that is the reason each joint gives us two equilibrium equations we need to consider the free body and then we need two free body of that particular joint and it reapply these two two unknown forces may be obtained since we have two equations two unknown forces we can find out since each member is an axial rod t wo force members it exerts equal and opposite forces on the joints at its ends so while we ta lk about truss this is very very important to notice that in most of the cases we for analysis purpose we consider those as two force members and we solve it the joints of the truss must be analyzed in sequence by starting at a joint which has only two m embers meeting with unknown forces this is quite obvious since if we have more members unknown members then we wo uld not be able to solve the joint or all the forces or at the joint or all the member forces at the joint so that we need to keep it in mind while you a re considering joint then the joints are analyzed in the proper sequence until all joints have been considered if necessary to find the unknown reactions consider the entire structure as a free body so sometimes this is done before we go fo r the unknown member forces so overall reactions support reactions we can if we can find out that becomes easy to find out the forces in the member refer slide time zero six hundred and seven the same example as we have already mentioned in the previous class that this member force five this member force five is supposed to be found out in the last week in the last lecture we have considered with one section here and in this example you wo uld not consider section but we see how can we find out the forces using method of jo ints because method of joints is most more important why we will be solving three dimensional trusses that there it helps method of section does not help much so three unknown reactions this is one arrow has to be put here this is a reaction r6y this is r oller support that i s why only one reaction there are two reaction because it is pin joint support then we have horizontal forces so there must be some reactions at four in the horizontal direction several methods are available for analyze truss structure t wo are discussed and applied in solving this example two means one we have done already other we will be doing now refer slide time zero seven hundred and thirty-eight so here we find out the overall reactions of the structures from the support as we have already discussed someti mes it helps a lot for using method of joints that is what is done so in this case it is considered that these supports are removed and there are two reactions here at this point and one reaction here is acting in this point and a summation of m4 equal s to zero \u2211m four zero that means we are considering moment about point four is equals to zero so that i s what is done two hundred zero multiplied by ten four thousand multiplied by ten this way this way this way it is acting and one thousand multiplied by thirty ten ten ten acting t his way all are in the same direction twenty r6y this is acting the other way as it is which is better to put a an arrow on this so this is acting in the other direction so that is the reason the equation is form this way and if we solve this equation we will easily get that the vertical reaction is four thousand, five hundred pound once we have found out the vertical reaction what at join t six what we are doing is that we are considering s um of horizontal forces equals to zero and s um of sum of vertical forces equals to zero the sum of horizontal forces will give us these are known force because there is no unknown no more unknown remaining and the sum of vertical forces will give us this unknown reaction because this is already known so accordingly what we get we get r4x is equal to two zero pound it is quite apparent from the structure also that it is supposed to balance force is supposed to be balanced by this because there is no other horizontal force in overall weight acting on the system and for y is equals to if we consid er the vertical equilibrium i think there is a typographical mistake so what is the mistake is this r4y acting upward two are acting downwards so this should not be there this should be r6y equals to zero so r6y is already known so from that there we can easily find out r4y as equals to five hundred pound refer slide time one thousand, one hundred and four so the direction of unknown forces in each member are assumed as in the previous example and vectors are changed on the sketch when they are found to be negative so this is a general convention we do and that way it is it is shown here so what we are doing first is the joint four is separated out first this is the joint four disjoint method of joints the other way if we look at it is something like this here is a section cut out and this joint is kept aside so if we draw a free body diagram for this particular joint and as we have already discussed horizontal force summation equals to zero particle for summation is equals to zero and that is what is applied here and that gives us f2 is equals to two thousand pound and f1 is equals to five hundred pound so this method is really easy but it is this kind of tedious method we need to follow step by step the joints and we need to find out the forces refer slide time one thousand, two hundred and twenty-seven so once we have fou nd out the joint four see this member force is already known so if we consider this joint here the unknown forces are this and this so we have two equations easily we can find o ut these two member forces that i s what is done here in this the joint f3 is taken as a kept aside free body diagram of that joint three is prepared five hundred is the f1 force is a pplied here external force two thousand pound is applied there then it i s simple its vertical moment equilibrium is considered sorry vertical force equilibrium is consid ered forty-five degree and if for sine forty-five degrees it goes to zero and then it gives us that f4 is a goes to seven hundred and seven pound and similarly if we consider the horizontal force equilibrium so seven hundred and seven cos forty-five comes here and f3 we can find out as two thousand, five hundred pound so there is i do not think much things to explain only we can see where to move to find out the member force unknown member force f5 so if we claim this at present after solving this member forces is forces known this member forces known this member force is known and if we come here in the last slide we have found out this member force also so considering this joint this is not known this is not known so only two unknowns are there so if we attempt this joint we can easily find out the f5 whereas if we attempt this j oint here we do not have two or less unknown so we have three unknowns here so better not to attempt this joint it is better to attempt this joint and accordingly to find out the member force and since our aim is to find out the f5 here we have only ou r only two we have a considered if vertical equilibrium only fy in the y direction equilibrium only and accordingly we get i think this is another mistake seven thousand and seventy forty-five degree is not correct this is seven hundred and seven only this is not there so with that we get that f5 is equals to five hundred pound refer slide time one thousand, five hundred and forty-seven so we will have solved two problems two problems one in one method the other one in two methods and this one is not exactly our principally trus s but we can solve this problem considering trus s concept and let us see how do we do because in general the truss members are not loaded transverse to its axis so but in this particular case this member and this member is loaded transverse to the this axis in the upward direction so principally this is not a tr uss but this type of problem can be solved using concept of trus s let us see this structure usually are classified as trusses because of the reasons as i told you since the analysis is similar to that used for trusses as shown in member one two and two three are n ot axial rods and separate free body diagram for these members are required so as i told you we need to consider these two members as a separate free body and we need to do let us see how do we solve this problem refer slide time one thousand, seven hundred and twenty-five since eac h of these members has four unknown reactions two at this end two at this end the equations of static equilibrium are not sufficient to find all four unknowns it is possible though to find the vertical reactions r1y r2y r2\u2019y r3y equals to one hundred pound and t o obtain the reactions r1x equals to r2x and r2\u2019x equals to r3x from the equation of equilibrium so this is more on like a equations of equilibrium is applied and from the symmetry of the structure we can find out that since dimension i do not remember i need to go back this is twenty inch this is thirty degrees so this dimension is not required so that i s total two hundred pound is acting here it is completely symmetric one and it is shared by these two that is the reason it is said all these forces ar e equals to one hundred pound and this is in the transverse completely transverse direction it is acting and these two has to be equal otherwise equilibrium are to be maintained that is the reason we say that r1x is equal to r2x and r2\u2019x equals to r3x so member one two if we look at horizontal equilibrium gives these two and vertical equilibrium gives these two and from symmetry since the two are two symmetric we can easily consider that these are one hundred pounds this already i have discussed so this is we can s kip now refer slide time two thousand and four when the unknown reactions obtained from member one two and two three are applied to the remaining part of the structure as a free body it is apparent that the rest of the analysis is similar to that of previous example so it is almost similar to the previous example as it is said those forces are applied here as shown here and then considering joints one after another we can easily find out the forces so first this joint is considered so s1 we are keeping the name here as s1 here also we say s1 so it please do not get confused with this s1 and this s1 better in this course let us make it this is a 351s so this is 351s sine thirty is equals to one hundred from this vertical equilibrium equation we can get and 351s is two hundred that is what we get so this is 351s this is three five and corresponding way the r3x what we get the horizontal that we have got that those are equal these two are equal but what is the amount or how much pound it is that we did not find out so this is the value of that force so this joint is known we move to that second joint r five so in this what we can say that this s1 is it actually is 451s this is four five and it goes on this is four five so please consider that this is four five so what do we do in this how many unknowns we have this two hundred is already known from the previous example from this joint there is no other forces acting so this is two hundred about this joint if we look at what the forces are acting in the transverse direction from simple equilibrium we get that this force is two hundred so from there if we look at this is thirty degree yes here it is written this is also thirty degree so this is cos component acting in this direction two hundred cos thirty this is acting in this direction this one and this s2 sine this is also acting in this dir ection so this makes us the summation of f x equals to zero and remaining part i think only to put the numerical values and we can find out we get the equation of s1 and s2 so if we go for the vertical equilibrium direction so this two hundred sine thirty this is this component is coming here and then two hundred it is being added this one this is the two hundred and this vertical component is this is coming here and along with that this is also coming this s2 is coming as cos sixty so that gives us another equation with s1 and s2 this is second equation and if we solve these two equations we get s2 equals to two hundred and 451s is equals to four hundred so well this is explaining is much easier but while we solve problem we do sometimes small mistakes be careful while you solve problems and in this joint we have found out at this point of time this is known this is known this is found out and this is also found out let us move to the next slide refer slide time two thousand, five hundred and forty-two this slide is about joint one reactions at one on wall we need to find out here this four hundred pound is already known b ecause this is pin joint and it i s a two force member this is already known one the reaction here we need t o find out reaction at one that i s the reason it is stated reaction at one on the wall so r ox or 0x sometimes we say reaction is we are considering this as one thousand, seven hundred and thirty-two is that this member force already you have found out those are equal and we have got that and this two hundred cos thirty is coming from this member this is also thirty degree so that is the sorry this is thirty degree so that is the reason we have the cos component here and that gives us the horizontal force as three thousand, four hundred and sixty-four pound and the vertical equilibrium condition if we consider from same this member force sine component is coming and that gives us two hundred pound as the vertical force here one important point better to note down with that point we will conclude all members except one two and two three may be designed as simple tension or compression members the horizontal members one two and two three must be designed for bending combined with axial and shear loads this is what i try to tell you inform you at the beginning of the solution of this problem so these two members are not designed completely as axially loaded members these are designed for shear loads as well if th e member the force is much more bending moment is also much more then we sometimes need to design it for bending moment also with this let us conclude todays lecture refer slide time two thousand, eight hundred and twenty-one references are as usual i do not find any point to repeat refer slide time two thousand, eight hundred and twenty-six what we have learned is that truss structure mainly three examples who have done on truss structure plane truss structures and in the next lecture we will move to the three three dimensional structures basically the three dimensional trusses which are very very popular in aircraft structures big example is if you if you look at the tail boom of helicopter those are three dimensional trusses not only that those are still being used you can find many small helicopters use that three dimen sional truss tail boom of helicopter not only they are in many other places most important the basic analysis of any landing gear is considered as a three dimensional truss structure and the primary analysis of the landing gear is generally done you consider ing those as it truss structures and then more fine analysis more detailed analysis is carried out while we have other forces found out and we continue that way so with that thank you for attending this lecture we wi ll come back with three dimensional truss next in our next lecture thank you"}
{"audio_filepath": "/media/rishu/Data1/Code Playground/test_ai4b/wav/14.wav", "duration": 1753.83, "text": "en space structures welcome back to aircraft structures one this is professor anup ghosh from aerospace engineering iit kharag pur we are continuing the lectures for the week three or the 3rd week in the last two lectures we have covered plane truss and this lecture we will start with the space structures then truss is something where all the members and forces are in one plane it may be any plane xy y z or zx any plane or may be in any arbitrary plane but in case of space structures it is in more than one plane practically if we look at all structures our space structures so we need to consider those loads but in general we do not consider the outer plane loads and we take components and try to make the analysis easy and accordingly we do but there are some cases where we need to analyze space structures so let us get introduced to the space structures and i try to follow what the procedure is refer slide time zero one hundred and fifty-seven this is as usual the recapitulation slide already i have covered many times but it is always better to say the salient points we have learned the history that i s very important i feel as you will grow older you will feel that history is very very important so not only history of solid mechanics our structural analysis but also we have seen the development of fixed wing aircraft and then we have come to the loads encountered by aircrafts that is very very important in comparison to the structural analysis because all the loads has to be he has to be borne by the structures successfully efficiently and then that will serve the purpose very well so as already we have mentioned in the last class we have c overed the plane truss refer slide time zero three hundred and six and today we will cover space structures and mainly truss will cover though it is written structures but trus s in the sense where transverse loads are not there in the structural members structural membe rs are predominantly considered as a member which is two force member but in one the example what we will solve there it will also experience some torsional moment so in that sense we may call this as structures not as trus s but the analysis procedures is similar you can easily go to wherever you want refer slide time zero three hundred and forty-eight as a general introduction let us try to get introduced with the problem equation space structures equations of equilibrium is most necessary thing we need to find out the equ ation equations of equilibrium to solve problems most structures must be designed to resist loads acting in more than one plane this is what i was telling you a few minutes back but in general we reduce it to a plane structure so that problems becomes ea sy consequently the structures are actually space structures so all structures are actual space structures that is what is mentioned here although in many cases the loads in each plane may be considered independently and the structures are analyzed by the method analysis of coplanar structures so this is important we many times try to reduce the problem length understanding and we solve it in this way when it is necessary to consider assume sorry when it is necessary to consider simultaneously the f orces acting in more than one plane the method of analysis are no more difficult but it is often more difficult to visualize space geometry of the structure this visualization creates real problem and this i would like to take the opportunity to say somet hing more in this point and this is the reason it is very very difficult to solve by visual observation the space structures and that has initiated the analysis of all space structures with help of finite element analysis where three dimensional geometries a re created in cad software\u2019s and it is easy to visualize and to get the force components and moment components in an analysis of space structures it is desirable to draw several views of the structure with the forces shown in all views so unless we draw sever al views and show the forces it i s difficult the equilibrium of any free body is in space is defined by six equations three equations of forces and three equations of moments this already we have discussed once or twice we have brought in again as a reminder refer slide time zero six hundred and thirty-two the components of force r this force from here to here in space along three mutually perpendicular axis xy z may be obtained from the following equation so it is simple resolution of the vector r in x direction cos componen t is coming if fx r cos if fy r cos and fz r cos where alpha beta and gamma are the angle between the force and the x y and z axis respectively as shown in the figure the figure sh ows it very nicely but it is difficult to visualize these angles in real problem that really creates a big issue we will see how do we solve it the basic principle is this but we will use in a different way so that it becomes easier to understand and solv e when the three components are known the resultant may be obtained from the following equation this is well known equation i do not think it requires some explanation if the resultant force or one of its component is found the remaining components may be obtained from the geometric relation r by l r divided by the length of the vector and if fx by x this component fy by y fz by z where x y z this is z are the components of length l along the mutually perpendicular reference axis betteryou we corre ct this here this is z refer slide time eight hundred and forty-six how to take moment consider moment thats a really important issue we need to learn moment in space structure the moment of a force about a line is obtained by projecting the force to a plane perpendic ular to the line and finding the moment of the component of the force in that plane apparently there are two things i should mention about a line in two dimensional plane frames structures we were taking moment about a point not about a line so this yo u please note that it is about a line and what do we have need to do we need to consider the component of the force on a plane which is perpendicular to the line about which we are trying to consider the moment so let u s truss it for the description the force p in the figure has component p2 parallel to axis of moment this is axis of moment this is axis of moment we may say o prime and p1 in a plane perpendicular to the axis of moment so this plane what we see this plane is perpendicular to this ax is of moment the moment of the force about the line is p1 cross d so d is the perpendicular distance from this p1 force component to the axis of about which we are trying to find out the moment since the component p2 has no moment about the line so this will not have any moment because it is in the same direction another point you should do monitor here that see cos with this component we can easily have a plane with this line and this component of the force can exist on a plane so that i s the reas on it cannot have a moment about that plane about that line whereas this is on a plane which is perpendicular this to this o prime so it is having a moment so looking at this simple principle if you keep it in mind it helps to solve the problem it may be noted that may be noted that a force has no moment about any line that is in t he same plane as the force that i s what i said it in a different way refer slide time one thousand, two hundred and eight a problem is of a landing gear lending gear is having three components thi s is the main component with which the wheel is attached these are two supporting members so dimensions are given here as well as it is given here this view is if we look at this view is if you look at from this side this side i want to mean it is on y es it is here vd plane and this view is on that sd plane this way so this view is this one and this view is this one so please keep it in mind that these are the two views landing gear problem find the forces at points a b and c for the landing gear sh own in the figure members ob and oc are two force members this ob and oc are two force members member oa resist bending and torsion but point a is hinged by a universal joint so that the member can carry torsion but no bending in any direction at this point so this member cannot carry bending it can only carry torsion so what are the six we have six equations of equilibrium what are the six unknowns it is mentioned here one unknown the first unknown is force here second unknown is force on this the two force member third one we may say that this is the torsion acting on this member and they maybe three more forces acting at this we may consider those as ad as and av please do not keep in your mind the directions because for problem solving directio n maybe the other way taken in the drawing will follow that drawing but for principle to understand what are the unknowns these are the unknowns and let us proceed to solve it refer slide time one thousand, five hundred and ten first about the torsion components first consider the components of the torsional couple at point a here the resultant couple vector t shown in figure below must be along the member so it is along the member as i showed you in the last slide and it is it has components tv about vertical axis and ts about the side axis this is please you may note that this is vertical axis this is dragged access this is side axis so that way tv ts and t is acting on this member by proportion of concentration of component of vector tv forty tv by this member forty ts thirty and t fifty tv this is the length we get a relation which is tv eight t ts six t if you have probably understanding this relation you can easily think about resolving the t along two components you can easily find out the cos components from these three known values so it is nothing but those cos components are considered and a ratio in that form it has been stated here refer slide time one thousand, six hundred and forty-five so here we have a relation between components of torsion those components are shown in this figure here all the unknowns are also shown as i mentioned there are three forces acting on a and we need to find out those forces and let us see slowly how do we get as i mentioned previously that in the free body diagram for the inter structures shown over there are six unknown forces so six unknown forces are these are components do not take it that way the torsion is the unknown and this actually the torsion acting on along this is the unknown and this is say ad as av three and this and this these are the six unknowns the forces at b and c act along the member t wo force members therefore there is only one unknown at each point the force at a is unknown in direction unknown in direction and must be considered as three unknown fo rce components or as an unknown force and two unknown direction angles usually it is more convenient to find the components after which the resultant force may be obtained from the relation r is equals to over root fx square fy square fz square two hundred and twenty-two x y z r f f f the couple t is also resolved in two components about s and v that is what is shown here taking moment about an axis through the point a and b so this is what we are doing that mab is written in c we are considering moment about this line that i s why mab is written here so sum of moments moments about ab what are the components will come since four thousand is written here this is coming thirty-six where from thirty-six is coming this distance is six in the previous diagram it is noted that there is in thirty-six this is thirty six thirty-six and i t is acting upward is four thousand is acting upward that is there is not it it is thirty-six then multiplied by c forty by this is cos component only c is on this plane the front plane this is on this plane the c is acting so if it is acting on that plane about what is t he perpendicular distance that perpendicular distance is thirty this is the perpendicular distance as it is mentioned where the component component is forty by fifty from the previous diagram or if we consider the angle it comes forty by fifty fifty is this length because this is thirty and this is this is also thirty that is there is thirty by thirty square top portion so this is fifty and accordingly forty by fifty comes as the component \u2211m ab four thousand x thirty-six c x four thousand and fifty x thirty zero c six thousand lb now it may arise in your mind why one thousand is not considered that gives us the value but why one thousand is not consi dered one thousand is pound is in the same direction of av so it is acting in the same direction so it does not have any component ob is passing through a b this is the two force member this is passing through the axis about which we are considering move ment so it is not having any moment component that is there is in one thousand and this ab b force is not having any component and we get the value of c at the end of this exercise okay let us move to the next slide refer slide time two thousand, one hundred and thirty-one in the next slid e what we have is all the unknown forces and the four thousand pound load act through member o a the torsional couple t may be found by taking moment about line oa if we consider a moment about this line then component of these the forces of a are getting cancelled because it is on that line so we do not need to consider that b is also acting or crossing that line so there will be any component of from b c also there wo uld not be any component only the component will remain from this four thousand pound also will not have any component y that four thousand pound is on the same plane as the o a is that is the reason you do not have this four thousand pound is actually acting on this plane and o a is also in that plains of this four thousand pound will not have any component in that plane so the torsi onal couple t may be found by taking moments about line oa the one thousand pound drag load has a moment arm of forty-eight inch that forty-eight inch is shown in the previous figure if you do simple geometric calculation you can here it is shown here it is shown four point ei ght but where from do we get this is six inch from the 6inch component in this direction is having forty-eight so that i s what is used here and so what we have is the as shown in the figure and we are considering moment about ao that means about this axis no compon ent of a is coming there no component of four thousand pound is coming there no component of b no component of c so easily we can find out one thousand cross forty-eight this way it is actually is the contribution to the torsional moment and that is equals to four thousand, eight hundred inch pound and as we have already found out the components of tv and ts those are tv eight t which is equal to three thousand, eight hundred and forty inch pound and ts six t again there is a typographical mistake please excuse me this is t may be written more precisely if i can okay so that gives us the force two thousand, eight hundred and eighty inch pound so the reasons why four thousand pound is not coming that i have already explained because it is on the same plane vertical load is coplanar to ao i have mentioned again for more clarification the other forces are obtained from the fol lowing equations which are chosen so that only one unknown appears in each equation so we are considering moment about os os is this exists and what we have ad in forty ad which one is ad this is ad other are not having because this is on the same plane this is also on the same plane only this is out of plane and acting perpendicular to this plane that is the reason it is ad is coming there and these are definitely these two are definitely crossing that line this axis so there that wo uld not be there wo uld not be any component so considering that equation what we have ad into forty forty is this length or this length and we have ad is equal to seventy-two pound the subscripts os originated designates and axis through the point o in the side direction we have menti oned it here and we need to continue what the other forces refer slide time two thousand, five hundred and thirty-eight so we are considering equilibrium in the drag direction solution of fd equals to zero if we consider summation of fd equals to zero \u2211f d zero it gives us the force b because in thi s direction this is known these are orthogonal to that direction whereas this will have a component in that direction this also will have a component in that direction but we we have already found out this force this is known force that is six thousand so that i s the reason the component of b we can find out but this five hundred and thirty-nine where from it comes it comes from this simple calculation the lid this is five hundred and thirty-nine where ob square is equals it is a continuation so ob square is equals to this and that helps us to make a compone nt in this direction horizontal direction so that is the reason this is the twenty and this is the length and that gives us the component in drag direction the other component is this is thirty and this is sorry fifty this is this is the fifty length this is fifty that gives us the component here and one thousand and seventy-two this is seventy-two already known and one thousand is acting here so as a result we get the force b and similar way if we consider in the s direction summation of forces in the s direction we find out the force a is as i had de scribed in very well the previous equation please try to understand these equations why this component is coming and definitely you need to spend some time to understand this equation also i would suggest you find out this component fv and find out the vertical force av so considering that as and av are known following the similar logic you can easily understand the components of forces in this direction and you can find out the force av and as a check since it is a three dimensional problem and it is better to have a check summation of av we are we have checked and we are considering the moment components about av this axis and we are trying to see whether it gives us that moment zero or not so you may consider that as a homework if it is not clear we m ay discuss it all so with that note let us conclude todays lecture in the next lecture again will solve one more truss problem and interesting landing gear problem with landing gear components concepts of oleo strut and all those who will discuss and w ill continue further refer slide time two thousand, nine hundred and four refer slide time two thousand, nine hundred and eight so references are all same references and what we have learnt from these slides are these space structures introduced to space structures and we have solved a learning gear problem we have how to conside r three dimensional structures to for the solution and that way we conclude todays lecture and hope you will join back again in the next lecture that is another space structure problem will solve thank you for attending this le cture"}
{"audio_filepath": "/media/rishu/Data1/Code Playground/test_ai4b/wav/15.wav", "duration": 2073.28, "text": "n space structures contd welcome back to aircraft structures one this is professor anup ghosh from aerospace engineering iit kharagpur we are in the third week\u2019s lectures this is lecture number fifteen covering space structures refer slide time zero forty-four and we have solved problems related to space structures one landing gear problem has been solved in our last lecture we wi ll attempt one more to solve but before that this is simple recapitulation that is the reason in the last line you see the mention of a landing gear problem other things it is better to keep in mind what we have learnt so far that is the reason i have put all the points in this way points are history of solid mechanics structural analysis and different types of aircrafts and then we went to the loads we have also learnt details of aircraft structures how thin wall structures are used and in we have learn ed the flight envelope we have learned the load factor how load factor varies at different situations limit load ultimate load all those things we have learnt shear and moment on wing we have learnt how it comes how do we need to calculate those from the external loads as well as on the fuselage refer slide time zero two hundred and three so with that introduction and recapitulation let us go for todays problem solving we will get introduced more in the space structures refer slide time zero two hundred and eleven so before we continue further it is time to introduce the landing gear in a proper way so what we have done here is that what are the key components of landing gear and how do those things act that has been describes let u s see landing gear a typical example of s pace structure the landing gear structure withstands the ground reaction and shock load when the aircrafts come into contact with the ground during landing in ideal landing condition the aircraft should land the ground with zero vertical velocity but t he actual condition it does have a vertical velocity and experience considerable ground reaction so this is the reason we need to need to design the landing gear properly so that it withstands the ground impact and it facilitates the landing in all asp ects landing gear consists of basically three parts we say that shock absorber torque links tension compression member here is a brief description of the members let us have a look the shock absorber consists of two telescopic tubes as the shock obse rver is called compressed oil is forced through an orifice in an art airtight chamber and the energy from the landing impact is absorbed by the oil and air this shock mechanism is called olio strut transmits bending moments through the two telescopic tubes the tubes however are free to rotate with respect to each other and add just the additional members it is free to rotate wi th respect to each other and ad just and additional members are called torque links are required to resist the torsional moments so this is all about the ol eo strut member if i give you a one modern day example is available in all motorbikes almost so those are the ol eo strut member and then this as it is mentioned using those tubes it carries the bending moment but since the tubes rot ate on one on the other it is not able to resist the torque but we need to resist the torque that is the reason we need to put the additional torque links lastly the measuring forces are transmitted to the body of the aircraft by means of tensi on compression members so there are tension compression members in addition to that we will see with the example how it is carried out in our example we will not come consider that the oleo strut member is under bending will only try to find out loads a t the ends of the members refer slide time zero five hundred and forty-nine this is the example we will understand this is the figure this is the oleo strut rod so it has to withstand these are the two force members this is a two force member this is a two force member y ou please look at the there is a projection from here to here where the wheel is attached please observe the coordinate system this is the drag direction and this is the vertical direction this is the side direction so that is the reason here it is shown that vs plane that means if you if you look from this angle this is the view that is the reason we see this projected one and if you look from this side we have this view that is on the vd plane this is the vd plane on that vd plane we have this look please keep it in mind the dimensions because all the dimensions are not mentioned in the other diagrams i have tried my best to keep associated with these figures show that dimensions you see some important points let me hear that this hinge point is below the top level this is the top level if we see this point has a distance of three inch from the center line of the oleo strut this is also at three inch apart so please note these two points this level as it is mentioned is here and this is also that lev el so please keep it in mind these levels so other things if we see the general description general steps for analysis determination of the parameters of the landing gear that is this track clearance angle height etcetera ground load calculation on t he nose landing unit and on the main landing unit design of individual members of the nose and main landing yes this is about overall landing gear analysis the example what we will be solving is find the forces acting on all members of the way landing here shown in the figure assume only torsion may act on a member but no bending so with that considerat ion we will try to find out let u s see how the problem has been considered refer slide time zero nine hundred and one some more preliminary understanding we need to f ollow otherwise it will be difficult to understand the problem properly for convenience the reference axis vd and s will be taken as shown in figure above with the v axis parallel to the oleo strut free body diagram of oleo strut and the horizontal member s are shown in the figure below this is in the next slide that figure is there this figure is not exactly the free body diagram free body diagrams will come in the next slides this is again repeated for understanding of other features force perpendicul ars to the plane of the paper are shown by a circular dot or a cross for a force towards the observer is the dot that means this force is towards me if we look at in this diagram this force is actually acting this way that is the reason it is towards me and this component this component is nothing but this component so those two components are found out this please keep it in mind these are not very precise calculation these values are approximated to these values so that the calculation becomes easy but principle is only to find the sine and cos component of that particular angle fifteen degree this angle is fifteen degree so with that understanding we can easily resolve the forces from the tire to the landing gear the v component of twenty zero pound force is twenty thousand side not twenty thousand cos fifteen degree is nineteen thousand, three hundred pound and v component is five thousand, one hundred and ninety pound i repeat these are approximated to close rounded figure so that calculation becomes easy refer slide time one thousand, one hundred and thirty-nine so the free body diagram what we are discussing is this fre e body diagram where we need to find out torsions at this point also this point is joined with this ig member this i j member so there will be torsion here torsional moments here that we need to find out and other force components are shown here what ar e to act at this initially we will not consider this top member ij we will consider the remaining portion this member as well as that means i want to say we will be considering this point as ae we will be considering cg will be considering eh for our ana lysis and then we will find out the other forces will also find out here it is as mentioned that ev ed es also we need to find out along with the torsion te here so let u s see this is what understanding w e need to solve the problem let u s see what is scripted here the angle of the side brace member cg with the v axis is tan inverse twelve by eighteen tan1 one thousand, two hundred and eighteen i think you can get from here this is the eighteen and the twelve is coming from this three is getting minus this is the three this is the angle so this is twelve this is eighteen so from there we get the angle necessary angle to resolve the cg cg is on that plane that this is the cg this plane view is put here and from there we get the components the v and s components of the force in member cg our cg cos three hundred and thirty-seven degree it comes eight hundred and thirty-two of cg and cg the other component that is s component this is v component and this is s component so the drag brace member bh is at an angle of forty-five degree that is quite clear from here because you see why it is forty-five as it is said thi s is twenty-three these two are at the same level this is this is three so this is twenty-three three is this is twenty and this is also twenty so that makes the angle forty-five degree and accordingly we get that v and d this is with respect to v this is with respect to d the drag b race membe r bh is at an forty-five degree angle v axis and the components are in force member along v and d axis are it is a kind of repetition by mistake so please ignore that part let us proceed to the next page refer slide time one thousand, six hundred and eleven so we have found out in the last slide that components of the cg and the cg and bh in vertical and horizontal direction horizontal in the side as we ll as in the drag direction let u s see how do we proceed further to find out other forces the six unknown forces ev ed es cg bh and te acting on the oleo strut are now obtained from the following equations to find out te what we can do we can consider a moment as it is mentioned here moment ev that means in vertical direction ev at through the point e in the vertical direction if we consider that what do we have we have component of this only because on this line if we consider the plane this way these two are acting in the same plane so then that wo uld not have any torsion as well as the cg components which is acting this way a nd this way this way as well as this way where this one this way i think this is may be corrected this is acting this way so these two are on the same plane so that that is the reason you do not have any component and what we have only component of this w hich is eight inch apart from the line and that gives us the torsional moment acting at this point e if we proceed further this oleo strut member is again put here in a different view vd view is put here that means we are looking from this direction we are l ooking from this direction so as it is convention we have seen this is the force this is the force which is from me towards the board acting or acting on this particular point cg s cg s is acting in that direction and other forces are shown so if we put it here that direction this is this way and this is this way this is cg s so we are considering moment about mes about point is this in the direction of s which is the direction of s here it is d that means direction of s is along this line along this line we are considering the moment if we are considering moment along this line what will happen cg and cg s and cg v would not have any component on that moment equation even this and this will have some component our vertical force bh v and bh d will h ave component bh v is apart say three inch apart this is the bh v inch apart and bh d which is twenty inch apart as it is mentioned in the previous diagram here also it is mentioned twenty inch so that is coming and the directions is as it is shown it is acting this way this is ad in this direction this is definitely in the other direction about this point this way this is this way this is also this way so that is the reason these two are minus and this is plus is considered so if we if we write that with the components as we have done in the last slide what we get that bh value is fourteen fifty pound and since we have the relation with the bh v and bh d those are equal and that value is nine thousand, nine hundred and thirty pound refer slide time two thousand, one hundred and fifteen so we have come to the stage where we ne ed to find out the other forces in the member cg in the last slide we have found out the member force of bh in this slide before we go forward for any other thing it is better to correct a small mistake this value is by mistake has one zero has come extra in all previous figures also you please consider that this value is five thousand, one hundred and ninety pound so with that value we will continue and we will see how the other forces we get so with this slide will be concentrating to find out the member forces in the member cg s as well as cg d cg s and cg v will become finding out that means vertical as well as the horizontal in the side direction forces we need to find out to do that we are considering the free body diagram as it is shown here all the forces are acting as we h ave mentioned dot is something which is acting from the board towards b so the other force may must bh v bh d already we have described those are not having any component here particularly because we are considering from the point e in the direction d from the point e in the direction d that is in this direction in this line we are considering the moment equation so if we are considering moment equation in that line what will be the components components will be from the vertical force nineteen thousand, three hundred pound whic h is eight inch apart will have components from in this point as cg s as well as cg v it is that is also shown here cg v is three inch apart if you look at the other drawings in previous case this is three inch distance from here to this point from the center line t o this point this is three inch so that is that three inch comes here and the twenty inch as it is mentioned here is this is twenty inch oh here it is mentioned sorry these three inches already mentioned here so now about the direction see this av is about this about this point in this figure we are considering moment so this is rotating in this direction that means anti clockwise direction about this this is rotating cg s rotating in the class clockwise direction that is there is in cg s is the opposite of sign than this vertical force and cg v that is also in clockwise direction that is the reason these two are considered positive and this is considered negative so if you solve this algebraic equation what do we get that cg is equals to eleven thousand, three hundred and fifty pound and the component s as we have already found out from the angles that cg s equals to six thousand, three hundred pound and cg v is equals to nine thousand, four hundred and forty pound now with the other forces let us see how do we find out we are considering the horizontal vertical that means horizontal two directions s and d and vertical one direction summation of forces will be considering and we will try to find out the forces acting at e that means ev es ed so how do we do this is from this figure if we look at summation of vertical direction forces we are to consid er from vertical direction forces what are the components will come cg v will come this is the re cg v is coming here one more will come here this is bh vand this is cg v so direction i have by mistake even opposite cg v is downward but the bh v is actua lly upward that is the reason these two this nineteen thousand, three hundred and bh vare acting in the same direction and see cg v is acting downward direction ev is considered along the direction of cg v and it is found that the direction assumed is correct that the reason we a re getting the value of ev as nineteen thousand, seven hundred and ninety pound similar way if we consider the s direction in the s direction we have es and cg s only cg s and es only so that gives us the value of six thousand, three hundred pound yes ed direction if you see ed will have two forces one is thi s as i have mentioned this zero is not there so that is the reason we have these two forces that is the bh d and ad and ed so assume direction is on that same direction of ad and we get the ed value as for say four thousand, seven hundred and forty pound so the unknowns what we hav e we have considered for the member ole o strut is known now the torsional moment at end e as well as three components of forces and the other forces acting on this like this member this member force this member force coming here three components here and te that makes the that means four unknowns here this is 5th unknown this is 6th unknown all the six unknowns are determined for the oleo strut member we have one more member at the beginning as we have already mentioned that i j we need to find out the forces so we will see in our next drawing the detailed drawing of figure of ij and how all those forces are acting on it refer slide time two thousand, eight hundred and forty-four so we had to find out the horizontal member forces in the member ij and the field body diagram is shown below ij will now we considered as a free body the forces obtained above are applied to this member as shown in the respective figure and this five unknown reactions are obtained as follows if we consider in the s direction the member forces we have a lready found out that the esand g is values these two values are same that is the reason it is acting one to the opposite to the other and that that gives us that is is equals to zero now we are supposed to find out along the sorry son of forces along id at point in the direction drag in the direction drag in this direction if we see what we have we have e v this is not f this is mid this is in we are considering moment about id from the point in the direction d so if we consider that what we have ev which is id is in which direction is in this direction and that is in this direction about this point so this ev is three inch apart that has a component acting here it is acting downward it is acting towards me this force so that direction is considered positive so if we look at here this is acting ed is ev is acting this way this is positive gv what is gv that is also acting this way multiplied by eighteen this is the distance eighteen and gs into two gs into two this distance from here to here this is two inch this is two inch gs into two twenty jv this is jv acting in the direction opposite to the ev that is the reason it is minus so these three are acting in the same direction it is acting in the opposite direction that gives us zero and if we solve this equations fr om this equation we get the value of jv as twelve one hundred pound now again if we consider the summation of forces in the vertical direction as it is shown here ev gv jv is already known id also need to be found out that that gives us since these three are known t his is known this is known and this is known that leads to the solution of iv as seventeen thousand, one hundred and thirty pound similarly we are supposed to consider moment about iv here we considered about id that means in the drag direction from the point i he re from the point i in the vertical direction about this line so this will help us to find out so if we see that te is acting here this is the force te is acting clockwise that is considered positive ed cross three this is acting in the opposite direction that there is in m inus and twenty jd is acting in the opposite direction as in the direct sorry twenty jd here it is shown opposite along ed but here it is considered in this direction and it is giving as a force so if we consider this way that solves the gives the understan ding better and considering that direction we have the jd force as one thousand, three hundred and seventy-five so similarly if we consider in the drag direction the summation of forces that gives us the value of id so with these considerations all the unknowns in the landing gear are sol ved even in the tor que links the forces are also solved and we can have a check we which we need to do in our next slide refer slide time three thousand, three hundred and fifty-six but we will see is it may be considered as homework what you have seen so in this slide what we see is that the reactions are now checked by considering the inter structures as three body diagram and summations in all the direction v d and s has been checked and moments equations are also checked and it gives us zero this may be considered as homework and you can solve this problem refer slide time three thousand, four hundred and thirty-four so with this solution of learning problem two examples we cover the landing gear solutions and we will move forward to the next lecture refer slide time three thousand, four hundred and forty-one and in this lecture what we have learned is that how to solve the landing gear problems considering that as a space structure and thank you for attending this lecture we will meet again in the next lecture with some other problem thank you"}

ghosh from aerospace engineering dep artment iit kharagpur we are in the third week lectures this is the last lecture of the third week lecture sixteen wing truss system refer slide time zero forty-one today we will solve a small problem considering a wing truss even we wo uld not call solve the total truss system a part of the truss system three d truss system will be solving today introduction as a recapitulation what we have already done we have learned some history we have learned how the structures are the fabrication or to some extent details of aircraft structures we have learned how load comes into the structure and we have learned what is load factor ultimate load limit load all those things we have solved problems how the wing experiences bending moment and shear force as well as fuselag e experiences bending moment and shear force and in last four lectures we have learned fast simple truss system and later on we have we have considered the problems of landing gear as a three dimensional truss structures or truss system refer slide tim e one hundred and forty-one so we will move forward to today with a wing lift trust solving of wing li ft truss let us see how it is done and how do we solve the problem refer slide time zero one hundred and fifty-two these types of wings are used for amateur aircrafts for various clubs by various clubs and for amateur flights so let us see how do we s olve the beam truss f ind the loads on the lift truss members lift truss members are this two member truss this is a member lying on the plane which is if we better to have a direction th is is y direction this is x direction and the up direction that means this direction is z direction so this is i think it is better to draw here y this is x so we can say that this view what we see is on x z and this view what we see is yz with this consi deration we will move forward to solve the problem find the loads on the l ift truss members of the wing configuration considering all lift on the wing drag truss this truss system is the drag truss system drag truss members of the externally braced monoplane wing is shown this is the external brush members these things we are supposed to find out the air load is assumed to be uniformly distributed along the span of the wing the air load is uniformly distributed as it is mentioned it is twenty pound per inc h along the length the diagonal drag truss members are wires these members are wires with the tension diagonal effective and the other diagonal carrying no load so only one is under tension whereas the other side is not is not having any tension the ve rtical load twenty pound per inch is distributed to the spar in inverse proportion to the distance between the centre of the pressure and the spars these are the two spars this is one spa r and this is the other spar so this member is joined to this spar cg and this member the ce is joining or supporting this part be this cg is sub supporting the ag spar and ce is supporting the be spar the load on the front is therefore sixteen pound per inch it is assumed as mentioned here inversely proportional so that is the reason the front spar is carrying fourteen pound per inch and the rear spar is carrying four pound per inch so let us see how do we solve the problem or find out member loads in the member cg as well as ce that is our task we are supposed to find out the member force are in cg and ce refer slide time zero six hundred and twenty-three here we have the front or the f ront spa r where as it is already discussed sixteen pound per inch load is distributed uniformly this distance is ten inch this is the total one hundred and eighty inch and we have a member that is from c to g this is the point g the front spa r is considered as a free body as shown the vertical forces at a and g may be obtained with respect to a moment of summation of moment at with point a and minus what do we consider is that we are considering the free body of the member of the member cg sixteen in into the total load coming considering this member about point a we are taking moment so this one hundred and eighty the cg is at ninety distance sixteen is the udl uniformly distributed load concentration and the vertical load g is acting there that is to support so from that way moment about xaxis at point a moment about xaxis about point a we are considering and that gives us the load cg as two thousand, five hundred and ninety pound considering no drag force in x direction is acting on the joint g so if we co nsider this joint g and taking moment about xaxis at point c considering the member cg what we will get is that this is sixty and this is one hundred this is sixty inch this is one hundred inch and the two forces are acting one is downward as zg and the other force acting here as yg so if we solve this in this direction we have the opposite acting to mome nt and from there we get that yg is equals to four thousand, three hundred and twenty pound this is the complete solution of the drag brace we will discuss this again but here it is to note that this four thousand, three hundred and twenty pound which is coming to on the member cg that is also acting in the this direction as four thousand, three hundred and twenty pound here and this the other force will discuss in the next slide refer slide time one thousand and three so in this slide what do we have if the rear spa r is considered as a free body as shown in the figure bm are the moment about xaxis at point b if we consider what do we have like the previous one we have solid the load intensity changes otherwise there is not much change in this equation it is similar to that so we get the force ze ze is six hundred and forty-eight pound as it is shown here considering no drag force is acting in x direction at the joint e and taking moment about xaxis at point c considering member ce this member ce but we have similar way as we have seen in the last one th at ce here also we have this force and this force this is equals to ze and this is ye and then accordingly what we can find out that ye is equals to ten twenty pound this is c this is e one more force is there but it is in the same line of x direction that is why ze is not considered and again considering no force is acting in y direction at the joint e and taking moment about y axis at point c what we can find out that xe multiplied by one hundred in the other plane if we consider xe multiplied by one hundred and ze multipli ed by thirty and we get the xe value so this is a similar visualization like this and we get the value of three hundred and twenty-four and this three hundred and twenty-four contribution we will see in the this is the force three hundred and twenty-four acting towards from the board towards me and that value is three hundred and twenty-four here it is acting so we need to consider the other direction moment to find out that so with this consideration or both the members cg and ce are found out in case of cg there is no force in the x direction whereas for the c e there is a force in the x direction refer s lide time one thousand, two hundred and forty-five with this understanding we also come to the last figure where as we as we have mentioned in the last slide the found out force of g is shown here and that three hundred and twenty-four is getting added up here see this is one hundred one hundred two hundred gives three hundred then two hundred plus this gives the eight hundred and twenty-four found in this vertical member so that is the reason that xe this direction force which is three hundred and twenty-four is added up and increases the drag member force so with those force combinations as it is drag members are there you can easily solve the answer is also given so you can solve the problem and find out the forces please note the addition of y and x direction forces a t joint g and e in x direction force is added three hundred and twenty-four in x direction force is added with three hundred and twenty-four pound at the third member from tip o f the wing and the adjacent members are added with four thousand, three hundred and twenty pound and one thousand and eighty pound respectively this is the one thousand and eighty pound as it is shown so with those member forces added we are supposed to solve the drag truss of the wing refer slide time one thousand, four hundred and twenty-eight with this w e conclude the third week lecture series and with help of the space structure system refer slide time one thousand, four hundred and thirty-two we have solved a few problems of aerospace or aerospace structures there are many more problems to solve but with this introduction i hope yo u will be able to attempt the day today problems of aircraft structures and will be so solve those problems for further analysis so with this i thank you for attending the last lecture of third week will start a new topic in the fourth week thank you f or attending the lecture"}
{"audio_filepath": "/media/rishu/Data1/Code Playground/test_ai4b/wav/17.wav", "duration": 1926.8, "text": "venteen introduction to energy methods welcome back to aircraft structures one course this is professor anup ghosh from depart ment of aerospace engineering iit kharagpur we are at the beginning of fourth week of the course that is known as module four this is lecture number seventeen we will get introduced to the energy methods principles of energy methods we will discuss in a very very brief way the concepts presented here is difficult to present in this few words so for further query or inquisitiveness to satisfy the inquisitiveness please refer to books advanced books available on variational calculus or energy methods related boo ks so with that let us proceed refer slide t ime zero one hundred and twenty-one as usual we need to recapitulate what we have done we have done we have done history of solid mechanics or structural analysis and then brief history of development of aircraft then flight enve lope and loads load factor how load comes into details of fabrication and internal fabrication details of structures then we have come across loads coming to the wing and fuselage of aircraft how the bending moment shear force has come in to the wing and fuselage and then in the last week we got introduced with the truss system in the truss system the advanced way of analyzing three dimensional structures or three dimensional trusses we have seen we have solved a few problems related to aerospace engin eering and then will this week will proceed further with the energy methods refer slide t ime zero two hundred and twenty-three energy method of structural analysis that is what is our aim to learn various methods we learn starting from the stationary value of potential energy to casting lianos theorem to raleighs method many many methods will come slowly and we learn dummy load method unit load method all those methods will come slowly and we will learn those things let us cross it refer slide t ime zero two hundred and forty-eight so energy met hod of structural analysis we are starting strain energy and complementary energy the concept of strain and complementary energy is the first topic we are getting into consider a structural member a rod in tension this is the figure you should refer for that figure shows a structural member subjected to a steadily increasing load p as the member extends the load does work and from the law of conservation of energy this work is stored in the member as strain energy a typical load deflection curve for a member possessing nonlinear elastic characteristic is shown in the figure please mind it this curve represents nonlinear elastic material that is the reason we see a curve it is not a straight line the strain energy u produced by the load p and correspo nding extension y is then u equals to integration from zero to y p dy and is express ed sorry and is represented by obd of the load deflection curve obd this portion represents that energy u refer slide t ime zero four hundred and twenty-three engesser in one thousand, eight hundred and eighty-nine called the area oba above the c urve as the complementary energy c and from the figure we see that c is equals to integration from zero to p y dp complementary energy as opposed to the strain energy has no physical meaning physical meaning of strain energy is described in the pre vious slide being purely a convenient mathematical one quantity so it is a purely mathematical quantity however it is possible to show that complementary energy obeys the law of conservation of energy in the type of situation usually arising in engineeri ng structures so that its use as an energy method is valid so we will be using that one and that whatever is shown said here that we can use it for structural analysis that will slowly establish differentiating equation one and two to is here the one is with u so with respect to y and p respectively gives that du dy is equals to p and dc dp is equals to y refer slide t ime zero six hundred and one bearing these relationships in mind we can now consider the interchangeability of strain and complementary energy suppose that the curve of the previous figure is represented by the function p equals to b y to the power n where the coefficient b and exponent n are constants then if we do a simple calculus we can find that you may be expressed as we have said earlier or using thi s function we can express it as one by n integration zero to p p by b to the power one by n dp or c may be expressed as this also n integration zero to y b y to the power n dy and if we take the derivative as it is given in the last slide what we get that du dy is equals to p and du dp is not having a straightforward equation it is having the effect of non linearity is quite clear one by n p by b to the power one by n similarly d c dy is becomes b ny to the power n or np refer slide t ime zero seven hundred and thirty-two now it is the most common case is the linear elastic one that curve is shown here this is the curve for linear elastic one and for n equals to one it becomes a linear elastic material and in that case du dy becomes equals to p as well as dc dy becomes equals to p whereas the other way du dp and d c dp becomes equals to y and the strain and complementary energies are completely interchangeable such a condition is found in a linear elastic member it is related to the load deflection curve shown on the right hand side clearly the area obd is equal to the area ob a strain energy and complementary energy it will be observed that the equations five and six are in the form of what is commonly known as castiglianos theorem this is more popularly known as castingli anos theorem in one of these the differential of the strain energy u of the structure with respect to a load is equated to the deflection of the load to be mathematically correct however it is the differentiation of the complementary energy c which should be equated to the deflection s o this is more appropriate it says instead of this that we have if you look at the equations in the previous page that you can easily understand refer slide t ime zero nine hundred and twenty-four potential energy of a structure consider and elastic rod subjected to a load p work done by the load during the displacement y is py assuming that this work done by the external force is independent of the path that is assuming that the force is conservative there is a big proof for that in advanced books let us assume this to continue change in potential energy of the external load is equals to minus py if the potential energy of the load is zero initially potential energy of the external load in the deflected equilibrium is v equals to minus py strain energy of the b ar due to the deflection is u equals to what we have already seen integration zero to y p dy the total potential energy of the system is defined as the sum of the potential energy of the external load and strain energy of the system that is what u v and th at we makes it that total potential energy is equals to integration zero to y p dy p into y refer slide t ime one thousand and fifty-five for an elastic body with external load p one p two p three p n producing corresponding displacement like delta one delta two delta capital delta l in direction of the load the total potential energy becomes u plus summation of r equals to one to n minus p r delta r work done by the internal forces during virtual internal displacement will be negative if the internal forces are virtual it is negative of that change in the potential energy or strain energy load p r remains constant during the virtual displacement so we can write that it is virtual change of energy delta u minus delta summation of p r delta r from one to n again if we look at the summat ion of p r delta r is the work done by the external forces which may be said as the minus of v potential energy of the external loads so summing up this with this concept we can write that the change of any small change or variation of u v is equals to zero and in language if we write that thus the total potential energy of an elastic system has a stationary value for all small displacement if the body is in equilibrium so with that concept let us proceed further we will see we will need to use this concept to solve problem refer slide time one thousand, two hundred and fifty principle of virtual work principle of virtual work consider a practical solid particle here it is shown subjected to forces p one p two two p n whose resultant is p r resultant is shown here as p r if we now impose an imaginary displacement delta r on the particle in the direction of p r then the imaginary r virtual work done by p r will be equal to the sum of the virtual work done by the forces p i in moving through the virtual displacement delta i caused by delta r so it says that if there are p one p two p three p four and many more up to the n and the corresponding virtual displacements are delta one delta two delta three delta four then and those are having resultant as p r and delta r what we can write that p r delta r is equals to p one delta one plus p two delta two and summation like that and in a summation form it is like that but before we go further here in this bracket i skipped this it is introduced that the virtual displacement is so small that there is no significant chan ge in geometry so that the forces remain constant during displacement with this concept we introduced the virtual displacement now if this is what we have p r delta r equals to this if the particle or the body is in equilibrium so resultant p r is defini tely is equals to zero so this side becomes zero and or in any portion of the this also is equals to zero or this is equals to zero and as a summation form we write that p r delta r is equals to zero and we say that this is the principle of virtual displacement a particle is in equilibrium under the action of a system of forces if the total virtual work done by the force system is zero for small virtual displacements similarly as we have introduced here the virtual displacement we can introduce here as a virtual force that is there is in this portion i have kept in small font because it is almost repetition of the same thing only instead of virtual displacement the same principle and concept may work in the same way and we may get one more equation where it is virtua l forces acting and we say that is as the principle of virtual forces refer slide time one five hundred and fifty the principle of stationary value of total potential energy will be discussing now before that we let us define again the virtual work done in two form one in the form of the virtual displacement and other in the form of virtual forces consider and lasting body in equilibrium under external forces p one two p two two p n let us impose virtual displacement delta delta one to delta delta n in direction of the loads and the n already you have learned that the virtual work done is equals to p r delta delta r summation over r to n since the body is continuous the imposed virtual displacement will induce displacement in the particle of the body the internal force do work on th e particle during the virtual displacement and thus causes an increment of the strain energy that is delta u of the internal strain energy this is a potential energy and then similar way with similar concept if we follow for the virtual forces if we assum e the work done by the internal forces to be independent of the path internal forces to be conservative we can straightforward say that the virtual work done by external virtual forces is equals to delta r delta small delta p r summation over r equals to n but in this point the assumption what we say that is not always true that is only true for hookean material but considering hookain material will proceed further refer slide time one seven hundred and forty-two internal virtual forces will remain sorry internal virtual for ces will move the particles through the real displacement this virtual work of the internal forces will increase the complementary energy of the system hence assuming the work done to be independent of the path virtual work done by internal forces is equa ls to minus of delta c i where delta c i is the increase in complementary energy so the total virtual work becomes minus delta c i delta p r capital delta r multiplied by small delta variation of p r and virtual p r summation over r equals to one to n since the body is in equilibrium this total system or the total virtual work becomes equals to zero and summation of delta r delta p r may be regarded as complementary work done by the external forces if we assume work done to be independent of the path summ ation of capital delta r small delta p r summation over r equals to one to n is equals to minus of delta c e where delta c e is the change in complement ary potential energy for the external load e represents the external loads and then from this equation w e can directly have the equation as minus delta c i delta c e is equals to zero and then we can say that variation c i c e is equals to zero so we say that this c i c e is called the total complementary potential energy of the system for a body in equi librium the total complementary energy has a stationary value like the total potential energy what we have already done refer slide time two thousand so let us apply the concept of stationary value of the energy into problem solving and we think with an ex ample we will see how that we can use and solve a problem this figure what you see here is a truss in this figure there are forces starting from one two three four to r one two three two r to n the figure shown at the right side is an elastic framework where delta two in the d irection of p two is required to be found out total complimentary potential energy is equals to c i c e as we have got in the previous example we can write that one as summation of i equals to one to k for zero to f i for individual member lambda i delta f i so if i is here the individual member forces so if we name the member one two three four five six like that it will come as lambda i f i where f i is the internal forces in the ith member f i will be a function of p one p two to p n k is the total number of members in the f rame and lambda i is elongation of the ith member due to the internal force so once we find out this value we can find out the total potential complimentary potential energy now as it is said it is having a stationary value what we can see that from the principle of stationary total complimentary potential energy we can say that the partial derivative of total potential complimentary potential energy with respect to p two since we want the delta two becomes equals to zero and then we go for partial derivation w ith respect to this this lambda i remains same delta fi delta p two since fi is a function of p one p two and p n we get this portion from this and whereas this portion except all other delta except delta to all other things vanishes because those are not fun ction of p two so this in a straightforward way gives us that delta two is equals to summation of i equals to one to k lambda i which is elongation of a member at member and then del fi del p two as the partial derivative of each member with respect to the force p two refer slide time two thousand, two hundred and fifty-six for linear elastic material elongation of ith member is lambda i f i l i e i divided by a i e i this is a very well known formula we have already come across this many times where a i e i and l i are the area youngs modul us and length of the ith member respectively for a nonlinear material this portion is just introduced to you to keep in mind that the case is not always true in case of nonlinear material what we can observe that if it is f i equal to b lambda i to the p ower n that same way we can find out the solution but it the equation changes a little bit we need to substitute that value and to carry out that operation anyway the equation twelve one whatever is there in the previous space that will give us the delta two for linear in elastic material where we have already seen that c is equals to u the total energy u is equals to i equals to one to k strain energy of summation of strain energy of each and every member strain energy of linear elastic bar under axial load f i is half of a f i lambda so that half i half of a f i lambda this is value of lambda is written here and total u becomes summation of a f i square lambda divided by two a i e i and that is what since we have seen this and c is equals to u in this energy exp ression it is desirable to express f i as a function of p one p two to p n and we get following the discussion what we have done in the with respect to last slide that delta two is equal to del u del p two and this equation this is the equation summation from i to k f i lambda i divided by a i e i and partial derivative of delta del f i del p two partial derivative of each and individual member forces with respect to p two refer slide time two thousand, five hundred and thirty-four procedure to find deflection of a framework under a load this is the standard procedure following similar to this procedure we will solve this problem solve the internal forces f i for all loads p one p two p n calculate lambda i equals to f i l i by a i e i for all members find out the partial derivative of del of fi with respect to p two that is del f i del p two is the rate of change of f i with respect to p two to find out this find out the loads in the members d f i d p two other loads removed and take the derivative of del f i del p two now calculate the expression what we hav e said in the last phase same expression and find out the deflection in the desired direction here p two is symbolic with respect to the previous discussion previous figure but this is not always p two definitely it is the direction of the desired force where we want to find out for this case in this problem it will be with respect to p because there is no other force in this member if there are other forces in the member then we need to modify it with respect to that force so this is a truss where we nee d to find out the vertical deflection at a p load is acting here so if it is a vertical length deflection is acting in this direction following this formula if we make it del f i del p and if we complete this we will get the solution refer slide time two thousand, seven hundred and forty-six so to go further let us first proceed for the solution of this truss joint a this is joint a this is joint a s one s two and p is acting this is forty-five degree simple equations are there so in the vertical direction both equals to zero that gives us s two equals to minus of root two p so this is a compression member as it is so and similarly we get that ish one is equals to p considering the horizontal equilibrium solution of fx equals to zero with respect to this point and that gives that this is a tension member then again we come to join c two and c is this s two s three s four s two is already found out is four is equals to minus p and since s two is equals to root two p minus root two p it is minus p and s three is equals to p similar with following the horizontal direction equilibrium so joint b if we come join b is a similar way we can find out s one is known now s three is known now the only two unknowns that is s six and s five so s five if we want to find out we need to consider equilibrium in this direction and similar way we get that s five is equals to minus or root two p and s six is equals to 2p so all the member forces are now known with respect to this we will use a table to carry out the further calculations refer slide time two thousand, nine hundred and thirty-two and we put the values in this table we have put the length of each and every member this is the main member one two three four five length is given as l root two l like that whatever is that these two are more that is why this two are more two and five l by ae calculated from here is constant it is assumed that all the member having same cross section and it is made from same material member forces in the previous slide we have found out that same forces are put here in all the forces those are also put in this figure so you can easily match those figures and then we are considering that del f i del p so this is the important step or is it is better to follow carefully what i am doing i am taking derivative of this this is one this is root two this is one this is minus one minus root two and this is minus root two this is two a nd then we calculate that f i l i a i by a i e i and we get these values it is nothing but multiplication of these two column we get and finally we get the summation here so the vertical deflection in the direction of the force is equal to seven plus four root two multiplied by pl by ae that is the final answer so with a little concept of energy method we can easily find out the deflection of a truss at a certain point and it works very well to find out the member forces refer slide time three thousand, one hundred and twenty-six with this le t us try to come to the end of the of todays lecture references our standard references refer slide time three thousand, one hundred and thirty-one we every week bring their slide and in this slide we see that the strain energy and complementary energy is introduced and we have said th at it is having a stationary value total complementary energy or total potential energy and using that property we can easily find out deflection of a point of a truss it is not only trus s it may be applicable for any other structure where we can find out similar way the energy expression so those problems we will see with those problems will come beam problems another slowly but before that we will get introduced to other methods with respect to trust and maybe with some tricky way of solving problems so with that introduction to future lecture let us end todays lecture thank you for attending it will meet again in the second lecture of module four next time thank you"}

professor anup ghosh from aerospace engineering department iit kharagpur we are in the mid of fourth week lectures where we will consider mainly the energy methods energy methods preliminary did definitions and derivations are covered in the last lecture this week we will cover the dummy l oad method and unit load method refer slide t ime zero fifty-three before we go into details in the dummy load method and unit load method better we recapitulate what we have learned we have learned history thats very important i always say always fill of solid mechanics or structural analysis or aerospace structures various types of external loads and conceptual structural details flight envelope and load factor c r and moment on wing and fuselage of an aircraft truss and space structures we have done and then we have come to the energy methods in our last lecture so we proceed refer slide t ime zero one hundred and thirty-seven today we will continue with that to dummy load method and unit load method refer slide t ime zero one hundred and forty-three the dummy load method what we will discuss today is we will take the help of the example what we have solved for vertical deflection as it is shown on the right hand side of the slide here this if it is asked to find out the horizontal deflection of this point a so how can we do so to do that we ne ed to take help of the dummy load method say let a fictitious or dummy horizontal load fictitious or dummy horizontal load p f be applied at a deflection at the direction of the fictitious or dummy load is following the previous derivation we can write that it is if it is capital delta f is a partial derivative with respect to that p f or the fictitious load and then the total energy gone for that in all the members that is f i square a l i divided by two a i e i that has to be taken a partial derivative w ith respect to the p i and it is summed up for the members one to k now let us try to see how it changes if we talk about in a general way so we can say that that force whatever f i is or the member force generated in each and every member is f i and ther e is a contribution of two forces one is the f i here where it the value is p because of p whatever force is coming that is a f i p and because of the fictitious load whatever value is coming that is f one p f so if it is a sum of those two functions we ar e considering that linear superposition is possible and then we can continue for the derivation this is square l i is considered that square is expanded here if we consider the partial derivation with respect to this term definitely this is equals to zero a nd this term is here written as two fi pf this is constant and this is the derivative we are supposed to take and in this term we have two f i one p f this is written equals to zero because since the load is fictitious at the end we are supposed to put a value r of p f equals to zero and definitely this total value will become the function value come zero for any case and that will make the total this portion of the equation zero the above function f i one p f becomes zero while we substitute the value of dummy load as zeros refer slide time five hundred so the finally what we have it boils down to the equation as it is shown at the top of the slide it is it is thats this slide where f i p because to the internal forces due to the external loads p one p two p n it could be as many as possibl e considering general case and f i one p f is equals to is the rate of change of internal forces due to the p f or the application of the fictitious load we will see look at this equation in a different way that will help us to solve th e problem so let us bring back the equation what we have put before we go for the partial derivation as we consider that the dummy force is also an external force considering the function f i equals to f i p f i one p f f i one p f partial derivative of this gives us that this is is equals to this so what we have we can easily replace this term with or this term with this term now remains f i what to do for f i for to use this formula we need to be precautious and we have to put that while p f is put to zero before summation this while we are calculating the f i we need to put that those values for the p f equals to zero and we need to calculate that so that actually because this but this is more p opular way to remember and that i s the way we generally ca rry on with keeping in mind that we need to put p f equals to zero before we go for the summation refer slide time zero six hundred and fifty-eight so let us solve that same problem what we have solved in our last lecture problem is easy procedure is you better concentrate on the procedure how the procedure is how do we do this is the original problem and in this case what we are doing is that we have removed all the forces and we have put a force p f because of the p f we are supposed to find out the member forces which wil l become that f i give us that f i 1p f so this case will give us that value okay so let us see the solution is very easy we need not to do much for this for this joint we have considered here and we have considered that considering that this equilibr ium of this what we can see that this s one is equals to p f and s two is equals to zero and similar fashion if we go for the joint in this joint what we can see that from the summation of horizontal and vertical equilibrium as the process may be if we go for since s two is equals to zero definitely s three and s four is equals to zero now if we come to this joint we have already s one is having a value of p f s three is already zero this is equals to zero and then s six s five definitely s six will have a value of p f but s five will not hav e any value if we consider the vertical equilibrium so that way what do we have we have values for s six s one refer slide time zero nine hundred and thirty-four and with that we move to the table that helps us to carry out the calculation in the table what we have put we have put those members and one after another this is the length of the member this is l by ae assuming that all the members are having same a and e where always a and e is divided there may be problems where a and e are not constant practically it is not const ant but for problem solving purpose in most of the cases this ae is generally becomes a constant value but a vary e sometimes in most of the cases are constant anyway these are the load for the external loads that here in this case the vertical load p this already we have solved in our previous class this portion we have solved today so please here in this please you please note that whatever is written underscore that is the subscript what is with cap is the superscript so in that fashion with that we have the member force this way and then we have the derivative of those forces partial derivative of those forces as one and one and then we calculate the first this portion value here it is that portion value it is nothing but multiplication of this and this this and this and that way we have those values and this is total multiplication of with this this is multiplied and we get those values so definitely since these are zero we have only summation summation gives that three pl by ae so delta f the def lection of point a in the horizontal direction is three capital delta f equals to three p l divided by ae and it is to the right why because the direction of the p f we assumed on the right hand side delta f has become a positive value so our assumption of disp lacement on the right was correct and it is deflecting on the right hand side this method to find out deflection in elastic structures is known as dummy load method why dummy load method because we are applying a dummy load p f we are applying a dummy l oad p f and using that we are finding out the deflection let us move to the next slide refer slide time one thousand, two hundred and thirty-nine before we move further for the unit load method we have already observed that energy is required to be found out for various cases and in the next example what we will be solving using dummy load method we need these expressions so that is the reason in this in a very brief way energies for tension compression bending and torsion is derived here this is not derived definitely i would sugge st you to please find out how do you get that curve u for a certain member for a tension p square l by two ae you get having a cross section a modulus of the a i e and length l i think a little effort if you put you can easily do we will see the other port ions if we look at the next one if a bar is a beam is bending like this the radius of curvature is r and x axis is along the span of the beam so we are considering x axis in this direction and then we have a relation for the curved beam under pure bendi ng is that one by r is equals to m by e i sometimes we get minus also that depends on the way we consider x and the way we consider r so since r is one by r is easily can be written as d theta dx this equals to the m by ei bending moment causes rotation of the plane section external work done on an element of length dx as it is shown here is equals to half m d theta the strain energy of the element dx and that this strain energy we are going to integrate for the length so u is equals to half m d theta we a re not putting limit because depending on the case we need to put the limit and we need to find out the total strain energy so that way d theta is substituted from here and it becomes m by e i dx and then we get the most popular form of u for bending or strain energy for bending as equals to integration of m square dx divided by twice e i so we have a similar expression for torsion let us see refer slide time one thousand, five hundred and thirty-five in case of torsion which is a bar of length l loaded at two ends by t the torsion a dx length if we consider the work done on element dx is equal to strain energy of the element dx which is equal to half t d theta and same way we continue d theta dx we as we know from the torsion formula is equals to t by g j and we integrate that substi tute that d theta this becomes half t square two gj dx and we get the formula it i s my mistake repeated so for the torsion the formula is this so with this consideration or introduction of a calculation of total strain energy let us move forward for furt her learning on the unit load method that is a very beautiful method refer slide time one thousand, six hundred and forty-one let us see how do we go for the unit load method it is very very similar to the development load method and let us have a reference with that method to under stand this unit load method if instead of applying a dummy load p f we had applied a unit load a in the horizontal direction it is we are talking about the same problem what we have solved and the internal forces in the linear elastic member due to the u nit load is the partial derivative of the forces developed due to the dummy load p f so from observations from mathematics it is quite clear instead of applying p f dummy load of any value if we have like unit load the derivation we need not to take it b ecomes the member forces becomes automatically the partial derivative with respect to the p f if those forces are denoted by f i one for the ith member then easily we can put this value here and the delta f becomes summation of i one to k l i f i by a i e i multiplied by f i one where f i one is the forces developed in the members due to application of unit load in the desired direction so if one f i one equals internal force due to unit load only in the direction in which deflection is desired in case of bending a similar expression may be obtained for dummy load method that i s what is written here this del m del p f becomes this value this is nothing but how do we get thats why it has been as a reminder written so this value becomes m one m one is the is the mom ent developed because of the application of unit load it sometimes get confusing please keep it in mind this statement in your mind while you are confused and we get the value m zero or m not bending moment at any section due to the actual loading m one bend ing moment at any section due to the unit loading applied in the direction of the required deflection similarly in case of torsion we can have similar equation t zero t one t zero or t zero or t zero is the torsional moment at any section due to actual loading t one is t he torsional moment at any section due to unit loading applied in the direction of the required deflection so in a summation if we look at dummy load method and unit load method is that in d ummy load method we are supposed to carry out the partial deriva tion and in unit load method we are statically finding out the moment torsion or the member forces in case of truss or the part of the partial derivative because you are applying unit amount of load refer slide time two thousand and twenty-nine so let u s try to solve a p roblem example unit load method find the magnitude and the direction of the movement of the joint c of the plane pin jointed frame loaded as shown the value of the value of l by ae for each member is one by twenty millimeter per newton because we are trying to find out who in dimension earlier things were not in dimension so we did not look at it but here l by ae value is given so we can find out in millimeter length of member one or dc from the other dimension this and this easily we can find out square root of those and it is two thousand, four hundred millimeter now if we consider the joint c is one this is simply considered as the summation of vertical forces equals to zero and from there we get that s one is equals to since the members are all known two thousand, four hundred is also known so we can easi ly find out that cost component this is the cost component is equals to ten and what we get that figure is not given here it may be said something like this this is ten newton this is s one this is s two so we are considering equilibrium summation anyway we ge t this and from the other component considering the horizontal direction we get the summation we get that s two is equals to minus thirteen three hundred and thirty-six newton now if we can not talk about joint d or section including joint d and c so to do that what we have done we have c onsidered a section this way and that section is shown here so either we can consider to find out a consider moment to find out member forces like say for s four we can consider moment about this point or we may have a horizontal and vertical equilibrium because s two is already known so any way you may go for go and find out the values of s four here in this particular case s four is equals to thirteen thousand, three hundred and thirty-six newton and s three is equals to minus ten newton so let us proceed further refer slide time two thousand, four hundred and five if we conside r a vertical section this is nothing but a section considered from this axis from here a section is considered now from the dimensions we may easily find out whether the triangles formed particularly this triangle this triangle this is right angle or not this is right angle or not may be checked from the dimension so that is what is done the b e this length b e is found out as he calls to one thousand, eight hundred mm and then this is definitely a right angle so we can do that ab if we talk about this ab this is also a righ t angle so from there easily we can find out that this length is equal to one thousand, three hundred and fifty now where why we have this length and this length if this matches with square of this square root of that two matches with this we can easily control that this is also right angle that will help us to consider a moment and know the forces so that check is considered here one thousand, eight hundred so the other way it has been done i think you can easily check it so considering moment about this point gives us the force s six s six this is then the perp endicular distance this distance is equal to this distance and we get that s six is equals to one thousand, six hundred and sixty-seven newton this is done for the load given in the vertically downward direction but the question is that to find out the movement of c it is not that ask that wh ether the c is moving how much it is moving downward or how much it is moving horizontally rightward or leftw ard anyway we need to find out this this much is probably sufficient to carry out a vertically downward movement but let us see a horizontal move ment we need also to find out that is the reason we apply one unit load here this direction in the above case while we need to find out the forces in the members due to unit horizontal load applied at the point c it may be calculated that s one s four and s three are equals to zero and s two is having value one and similar way if we proceed now the way we have done in the previous portion now from a similar session as considered in the above summation of horizontal and vertical forces are equal to zero individually will le ad to the solution s five and s six s five for one horizontal load is equal to six newton and for s six one horizontal load is equals to eight newton so with that we move forward for the next slide refer slide time two thousand, seven hundred and forty-five we have got all the values we need to fin d out the deflections as we have already described following that procedure we can easily find out the deflection so please keep it in mind that these are not the values of deflection because in the earlier tables l by ae was also included in the table i n this particular case it is not included so that is the reason the vertical deflection at c becomes this divided by the twenty what is given in the question and that gives us that this joint moves downward as five fifty-seven mm and if we follow similar way the hori zontal is minus of one thousand, three hundred and thirty-five here comes why minus how do we handle that minus so since it is minus we assume the load acting on the right hand side so the value has become minus so it is coming something one thousand, three hundred and thirty-five it is a small value and this value is one thousand, three hundred and thirty-five and the net resultant will be this so the magnitude is this that is five hundred and twenty-three mm and the direction is tan inverse one thousand, four hundred and seventy-eight with vertical so this is the theta indicated that is one thousand, four hundred and seventy-eight degree so with that the solution ends and we let us move forward for one more exa mple refer slide time three thousand and fifteen quickly we will try to cover this example in this example need to be cleaned this example is associated with bending calculations the structure is shown here let us read it carefully example unit load method semicircular beam the tubular steel post tubular means the it is annular section shown in the figure supports a load two hundred and fifty newton this is the load two hundred and fifty newton at the end see here it is supporting two hundred and fifty newton the outside diameter of the tube is one hundred mm as shown here and the wall thickness is 3mm as shown here neglecting the weight of the tube that means we are supposed to neglect the self weight find the horizontal deflection of c the modulus of elasticity is two hundred and six zero newton per millimeter square so what we are supposed to do we are supposed to find out the horizontal deflection as it is indicated here we first calculate the strain energy because of moment so to do that with the original load existing on the structure as it is shown here we are supposed to find out the moment at for moment in between from these two this c to b if we consider this this distance is nothing but this one multiplied by r definitely so that multiplied by the w gives us the bending moment considering that is acting this way as it is show n here and similarly it will it that the bending moment here from here to here it is since it is acting in this direction that will remain constant for the value what it at it achieves here that is equals to w into twice r this is twice r and that will r emain constant for the length ab that is what is written that in ba will remain constant so let us proceed further we need on in the horizontal direction so what we need to do for that let us see refer slide time three thousand, three hundred and eleven to do that what we have done is we have applied one unit load here in the horizontal direction and because of the application of the unit load we are supposed to find out the bending moment that bending moment because we have assumed the bending moment acting this way as positive this will act in the opposite direction and that i s the reason if we again consider this this this is nothing but the sine theta r sine theta and that i s what the mcb is because load is one that is why not nothing else is there and here it is we are consid ering x from the h ere which is equals to x because it is acting this way it is acting in a positive direction so that i s the reason we are considering that this is equals to x now we are supposed to find out evaluate this equation that that equation is e valuated m one is written here w r one cos theta this is m zero and dx is equals to r d theta and then what we have done that has that is integrated from zero to pi zero to 2pi and the remaining portion w to wr is the m1 and this x is m2 so with this we integrate and integration is not shown here in detail you can solve it as a homework and check whether you are getting this value or not so finally this del delta or maybe written as capital delta f any way you can write this and these are same please keep a note up about it and you see we can find out the deflection either four thousand, eight hundred and sixty-seven mm or five thousand, three hundred and thirty-three mm that depends on how do we assume the moment area moment it may be assumed as a thin wall structure equals to pi r cube t or following the exact derivation it can be found out using this formula that makes the difference between this and this and this anyway the value whatever we get is reported here and with that we conclude our discussion with energy method related to dummy load method and unit load method and we will al so solve some more examples to have a clear idea about the process refer slide time three thousand, six hundred and forty-four refer slide time three thousand, six hundred and forty-nine so as usual the reference slides remain same and what we see is that what we have learned is that dummy load method and unit load method with examples and also with derivation and with that i would like to thank you for attending this lecture and i would like to see you back in the next lecture with some more example thank you"}

this is professor anup ghosh from aerospace engineering department iit kharagpur we are in continuation of the fourth week lecture this is lecture number nineteen we are already introduced with dummy load and unit load method but unless we solve energy method problems it is difficult to unders tand properly that is the reason we will try to solve few more problems in this lecture and you should keep it in mind that the examples are solved in one method must be tried with other methods which will be covered in the forthcoming lectures refer slide t ime zero one hundred and twelve so before we go further it is better to have a recapitulation history of aircraft now already we have done history of aircraft and aerospace structural analysis various types of external loads conceptual structural details that also we have done how does it look like rib spar frames long runs all those things we are introduced and which portion carries what type of load and then we are introduced to overall source of load on any aircraft how the loads come and how what is flight env elop why do we need to maintain it and in design how does it help limit load ultimate load all those things we have already discussed shear and moment on wing and fuselage of an aircraft has also been discussed those have been discussed in with exampl es and then we have discussed problems related to truss space structures especially landing the gear problem to cover the space structures and then we got introduced with energy methods and we are continuing with that refer slide t ime zero two hundred and twenty-seven so today as it is the mentioned already that we will solve if you example problem refer slide t ime zero two hundred and thirty-two so the first example if you look at this example is considering the a beam a cantilever beam cantilever beam is loaded uniformly distributed load w new ton per meter as it is shown in the figure and you see these problems who will be solving both first by unit load method and then by dummy load method but whatever we do we need to need to consider that this energy strain energy for bending this is predo minantly a bending one we need to consider the bending energy and using the bending energy we can easily find out u either using unit load method or d ummy load method what is the deflection so to find out the tip deflection in this particular case free end or the tip tip deflection in this particular case for to follow a unit load method what are we doing we are applying one unit load here once we apply the unit load here and accordingly we may find out m zero and m1 here mx whatever is there without th e unit load that is actually the m zero and for this particular section and considering the direction of moment shown as shown in the figure we can easily say that the m zero is w equals to x square by two w multiplied by x square by two and m one is when this uniform ly distributed load is not present and then the m one that is equals to one cross x so this case is better to neglect this portion of the uniformly distributed load and then what do we have already the formula what we usually use to find out and that formul a we are using and putting the values like m zero m zero is wx square by two one by e i is there and x is there this m one value that gets multiplied w by two ei comes out we do integrate from zero to l here at the length of the b means l not mentioned only mentioned in the state text so visually we can mention again this way this is l so with this if we thats the reason the integration is considered from zero to l and x is considered from this into the left w ard that x to the power cube by dx and it is a simple way x4 and y4 will come and wl to the power four by eight ei is the deflection this is following unit load method now if we try to follow same example try to solve same example using dummy load method what can be done is that we can we can solve the similar way only we need to consider del u del p f and instead of applying unit load will have need to apply the load p f now it makes is equals to w x square by two p f x because of this p f load so we need to that the total strain energy as we substitute this value here this is w x square by two p f x whole square and the constant term is taken out integration is definitely again carried out for zero to l dx and then if we carry out further we have this formula is expanded this way w square extremes to the power four by four so this is not there is no nothing of p f so this will delphi derivative of this will go to zero there is one p f there is one p f so what will happen this p f will make that p f twice p f x square and while we will put the value of p f equals to zero this term also w ill lead to zero only remaining term is this one because p f will become one so in that case this becomes integration w x cube dx similar way w will come out and it will lead to the same result so whether we follow the unit load method or the dummy load met hod in both the case th e answer has to be correct that i s what we have learnt problem we thought made differ but answer should be same so the first problem for todays discussion is complete we will go forward for the next one refer slide t ime zero eight hundred and fourteen this example is a different type of example find the horizontal deflection of the arch shown using unit load method so first we will try unit load method how the unit load method works in this case find the to do that the equations remain same as for the unit load method it is the loading is symmetric if you look at it is centrally loaded so without any doubt we can easily find out that there the reactions are p by two at the two ends and for unit load method we need to apply one unit load p one beca use this end is supposed to displace whereas this end is supporting so there definitely will be one more reaction and that reaction is shown here it is not that two unit loads are applied if the concept is not that like that but the concept is to apply one unit load the loading in the structure is symmetrical about center line so that is what just now i mentioned moment at any section theta moment at any section theta if we look at how can you find out that is it will have two components one is this will give us the m zero and this will give us the m one so m zero if we talk about this is the momentum so this distance is nothing but one minus r into one minus cos theta and that is what is given shown here you see and p by two is also given so accordingly we get th e m zero calm part for m one the on is this much and this is nothing but r sine theta and since it is r sinetheta without doubt who put that one in to r sine theta and ds is equal to definitely r d theta so that i s the thing is put in into the in this form this is the value is put and we get this value so one thing you must notice that there is a two in front and the limit is from zero to pi by two we are not considering zero to pi the our structure is symmetric thats the reason if we find out the energy up to this and then make a double of that that gives us the total energy that i s what is done here so one by e ip by two r into this portion is because of m zero and the other portion r sinetheta this is m one so while we put this to value and we need to carry out the integration that is the remaining part need to do so in unit load method we need not to differentiate so if we follow steps sine theta multiplied by one minus cos theta is the only variable part and pr cube pr r these are also is there so makes pr cube by e i outside and then we need to carry out the integration this is sine two theta will become and then that i s there is in one fourth and one more half will come because of the two theta while we do integration minus plus is because of the integration sin to cos and here also sin to cos plus has become minus you put the boundary values zero to pi integration limits zero to pi by two zero to pi by two and accordingly this gives us one and this gives us minus one by two and it finally leads that the end deflection this end de flection if it deflates like this then this deflection is pr cube by twice ei so that i s what we have solved and let us move to next slide for another method the other method what we can use to solve this refer slide t ime one thousand, four hundred and twenty-three same problem we will try using dummy load method in this development not only that we will solve using dummy load method will also solve it without considering the symmetry so it becomes the equation becomes little bit lengthy and we need to solve it so let us try once usin g that method also how what the result comes and we will see will solve in that process so let us follow it is same only since p f is applied one more p f reaction p f is there since we are not considering symmetry we need to consider moment at this part also that is the reason phi is defined to help us to understand and after phi is defined we can easily solve the equation let m f is moment due to horizontal force p f if this is the thing as we have discussed earlier this is the arm for p f and that is r sinetheta and similarly if m f is the moment due to the reaction that becomes p by two r sin into one minus cos theta so mp is the moment due to the vertical load due to this load due to this load and if we talk about that load it is becoming minus of p r cos phi minus of p r cos phi it is acting this way all moments those are acting this way on this section this way or this section in just this way whereas this is acting in this way that is in minus f has come and p is the load r cos phi is this angle and that is transfer transform to theta as cos theta so that i s the i think you can easily get why it is like that from one hundred and eighty degree minus phi and that way we get it so the total energy total strain energy is here one by two ei m f plus m r whole square rd theta plus this is for zero to pi since as we said we are not going to consider the symmetry that is the reason in two parts the integration is take considered from here to here one part where p f that mp part is not there and from here to here one more pi by two 2pi where mp part is there so that square is considered similar way it is expanded both part this is the first part and this is the up to pi by two this is up to pi pi by two to pi and then again the derivation is considered and if we go for the derivati on this part is better we can easily concentrate so we are supposed to do derive it with respect to what i say that i am sorry p f so this is noted here this is going to be zero why this is becoming zero because as we will put that p f is equals to zero here p f will become equal we put zero that there is in this part will become zero this is automatically zero this mp is also automatically zero that is because mp does not contain any p f this is the part will remain that a m r this part m f p f will remain and here a lso mp part will remain this is also this also will go to zero so similar way if we do this also we can get as twice m r twice m r del m f this part only remains but these two will not be there this will not be something like this and will be zero now what w e have done we have put the values of the moment what we have found out here those moments values are put here p by two r one minus cos theta this is this part and r square sine theta is this one m f del m f by del p f and it continues that way so in this ca se also what we have we substitute these values and we get this equation refer slide t ime two thousand and eight so this equation is repeated from the previous page and if we simplify that it becomes i guess there is a mistake of this r square this because this r r square and r makes it r to the power four probably this is a mistake you please ignore that otherwise it is not going to be p r cube in the previous page also that mistake is there please ignore consider that this is not there so pr cube by two ei comes ou t then sine theta minus twelve sine two theta it becomes and similarly from the other one also pr cube by two ei is coming out and then we carry out the integration sine theta cos it becomes minus cos theta similar way plus one by four cos two theta zero to pi by two this is pi by two to pi cos becomes minus sine a sorry sine becomes minus cos and say here also sine becomes minus cos one by two concern comes out and similarly we get it this way so i think they a re also some typographical mistakes are there you may consider thi s two part if you carry out this integration you will definitely get this value so i would suggest you carry out the part and check whether these two equations are written correctly or not but finally the deflection what we see is correct refer slide time two thousand, two hundred and fifteen so if we move forward for the the last example this example we have a curved beam in this curved beam what we do we need to find out the deflection the downward deflection of this free end and the rotation of the free end rotation is cons idered in this way the rotation how it is taking place so let us see first here to how the deflection is coming it is a bending and twisting problem unless both are there there wo uld no t be any translation downward as well as rotation that is the reaso n following in unit load method we have both the energy due to moment as well as energy due to torsion and once we do that once we carry out that the m zero this is the important part here is to find out m zero m one and t zero t one so let us try to see how whic h arm is taking and which part is being considered for m zero and m one that is the most interesting part remaining part it i s simple calculus i think you can easily do probably better than me so that you can easily check and find out the values finally what you are getting so to do that let us do come we are to concentrate to find out the m zero first we have a load p acting downward in this particular case we are not considering this t or there is no t present at this tip it is because of only the applied lo ad p so do not get confused with that t is shown here just to give you the idea which way and how the torsion may act and how the phi is acting in this problem the there is no t is applied so what how the moment is acting in this particular section if we look at it at this section this p is acting from here downward so the arm for moment is actually this portion and that is nothing but the r sine theta this component so that is the reason p r sine theta we get for m zero and for m one that is nothing bu t while unit load is applied here removing the all other loads we get the r sine theta now about t zero t zero because of p what is the torsion at this particular section so in this case particular case actually this is the point where p is acting downward a nd what is the arm arm is actually this much and this is nothing but one minus co s theta multiplied by r so that is what that t one we get p r one minus cos theta t is acting downward r one into one minus cos theta theta and p equals to one gives us the applied torque is increasing the tip deflection this is interesting point see p is being producing a torsion which is which is moving the tip downward that is the reason we say in this particular case the torque what is produced by this p at any section which is theta apart is actually increasing the deflection vertical deflection downward so with this concept while we have all this value while we have this formula we are supposed to put that those values where and those values are put here p r sine theta r sine theta and then one by g j therefore the torsion part is also it is put and then the simple integration is carried out and that gives us that delta is equal to p r cube by a pi by four plus pr cube by gj three pi by four minus two so with this consideration let us m ove to the other part of the problem that is rotation of the end section a refer slide t ime two thousand, eight hundred so here we have considered some additional drawing we have prepared for better understanding what we need to see is we need to apply one torsional loa d torsional unit load in the direction of in the direction where the theta is increasing and accordingly we can find out whether it is what is the value of phi or the end rotation so for the rotation of end a and unit torque is applied at the end bendin g and torsion due to external load t this we have already found out for the external load p the other load is the most interesting in this part of example that is moment and torsion due to unit torque applied for the indicated rotation r now you see we are applying this unit torque why it is in this direction because this is tangentially tangential here and this is coming from bottom to the up from it comes from bottom to the and that is the reason following right hand screw system this is the vector now this vector is applied here as it will go further these two components will change following this arc if we one component will create a bending and the other component will create the torsion or induce the torsion so if this is in two separate colors are used here if we make a component this way this is this is the bending component and this bending component is a increasing the deflection downward and if it is increasing the deflection downward that component will be this is one this component is on e sine theta because see as we as we increase this is increasing so this angle is the theta this is theta so if that is increasing so this component bending component is a sine theta and the torsion component is cos theta so the bending component one unit torque and sine theta that is m one is acting there and cos theta is the component fine one is then magnitude of the force is fine but wise minus that minus is because you see this is the way it is applied this is actually in the opposite direction it i s acting opposite to the other torque that means the torque the way we have considered previously in the previous example it is acting opposite to that and that is the reason it has been considered as minus so in this sense we can see that this point wi ll go up because of this torsion this point will go up because as i said as i repeat this is coming going down and then coming up so that is the reason minus has come here and accordingly we have put those values p r one minus cos theta multiplied by minus cos theta rd theta and this is the bending moment part and then if we integrate we get the value of phi phi of is in this direction considering this is positive while it is rotating this way if this total value is positive we will be considering that th is is rotating this way so pr square pi by four ei pr square by g j one minus pi by four is the rotation value so with this solving three examples we conclude todays lecture the examples are very good refer slide t ime three thousand, two hundred and forty-five you may solve the same examples references for this is similar to or same as we have done previously and with this we come to the end of the lecture slide today and thank you for attending this lecture we will move forward for the next lecture thank you"}

process of introduction w e are already introduced with the history of solid mechanics w e have seen there are many contributors in that from different parts of the world in our last lecture and this lecture we will concentrate more on things l ike the development of aircraft it is a kind of timelin e view and we will see how industry considers the developm ent and fabrication of aircraft so with that part let us proceed refer slide time one hundred and twenty-four so as concepts covered slide if we look at in this the first controllable human flight we will see th e wright brother \u2019s flight and it is a nice photograph that time video was not there we will see that and basic deve lopments of aircraft structures a s we have said that this we will see in the two different way from the very lower end of the structural capability to the higher end of the structural capability as well as we will see the time line view how it is progressing it has progressed till date importance of structural design and analysis s o let us see let us proceed step by step refer slide t ime two hundred and twelve so to bring back really i always remember and always try to appreciate the work of leonardo da vinci he is not only f amous for his art related works but he is also famous for his engineering contribution also i n the last lecture also we h ave seen in this lecture also we see there are two photographs first is for a fixed wing we may say probably it was a flapping wing i do not have much information about it and the r ight hand side if we look at this right hand side one this one is a ki nd of helicopter design if we look at so with that one let us proceed further i t was proposed in the year one thousand, four hundred and eighty-eight this one was proposed in one thousand, four hundred and eighty-eight and this was proposed in one thousand, four hundred and eighty-nine s o with this let us proceed refer slide time three hundred and thirty-one this is the most fam ous photograph in the aircraft industry or aircraft development engineering whatever way we say in this we will definitely cov er the historical trend we will cover the historical trend here but we will definitely also start with the concept first fligh t which is on december seventeen one thousand, nine hundred and three at kitty hawk n orth carolina wright brothers or the orville wright one of the wright brothers orville wright was able to fly it for twenty second s it was for one hundred and twenty feet t hat is the initiation and after that probably the deve lopment is endless it is going continuing till date so we will see refer slide time four hundred and forty we will see in this page what we have noted down is development i n terms of a few key parameters as we have said that we will also again look back from the wright brother s plane where we are at present f irst if we talk about range and endurance that means how much it can fly and how long it can fly s o in that sense that that limit is one hundred and twenty feet it was the first flight and twenty second was the endurance from there we have aircraft which is solar powered developed by some commercial company zephyr which also comes in the category of hale or in the full form we say high altitude long endurance aircraft t his aircraft is able to probably fly endlessly s o one o f the example the highest flight record is noted down here that is three hundred and thirty-six hours twenty-two minute s and eight second s so we can easily imagine a flight which is almost endless from the payload point of view if we see one of the wright brothers was the fir st pilot for the first aircraft so we say it is for one person and it is on three hundred and eighty on passenger capacity if we look at airbus three hundred and eighty a irbus three hundred and eighty has a capability of five hundred and twenty-five passengers that in terms of how many people an aircraft can fly but if we look at in other sense it is very surprising to note the capacity of antonov or an225 model which has a capacity of two hundred and fifty tons or one thousand, one hundred meter c ube of space so either it has to fit it can carry this much volume which may weigh less than two hundred and fifty ton or it may carry two hundred and fifty ton maybe having a volume less than this capacity now if you talk about the speed another key parameter the first wright flyer was something about one thousand and ninety-eight kilomet res per hour to now we have the highest record holder from lockheed lockheed and martin sr seventy-one blackbird it is advisable that it is not possible for me to cover each and every content with detail from the internet or from other referenc es better you please look at the open resource or on the internet and have a look that gives a different feeling s o lockheed an d martin blackbird is thirty-five thousand, two hundred and ninety-six kilomet re per hour is its speed that is about aircraft but if you look at the speed of any flying vehicle that comes about twenty-eight thousand kilomet res per hour the space shuttle columbia so that is many jump s in may be in terms of hundreds and thousands now if you look at the wingspan this is a very s urprising point here wingspan w right brother \u2019s plane was about twelve meter in wing span and at present if you look at the longest wingspan civil aircraft that is seven hundred and ninety-eight meter a380 there is what i say the known story about it that airbus has t ried to keep it within eighty meter s their first design initial design a preliminary design was much more than that then they have improved their design with additional lifting devices and many other things they have limited it to seven hundred and ninety-eight well within eighty meter s to which makes the a380 to be usable in many of the airports throughout the world and if we look at the other one an225 that is having eight hundred and eighty-four meter s it is slightly more and about eighty-four met ers more t han the allowed one so it is not able to land everywhere it needs some special attention about the weight if we look at the super heavy one the lift launch vehicle of saturn v that is height is one thousand, one hundred and six meter diameter one hundred and one metres mass two million, nine hundred and seventy thousand kg it is a problem of english and indian system suppose we look at in different way twenty-nine lakh seventy thousand kg s o the other way also we may say about two nine hundred and seventy zero kg anyway this gives us a fair idea from where from one hundred and twenty fee t to how long it has progressed s o let us have a l ook in a different way with a slow timeline view of t his progress in a different frame refer slide time one thousand and forty-seven this is with courtesy to wikipedia s o we have segmented development in different slide s one after another i f you look at it in flying vehi cle history of aviation in that it is the balloon which starts it s maybe in one thousand, seven hundred and eighty-three and then it continues i t continues slowly and then it bifurcates again to zeppelin zeppelin is a very popular too l in around the year one thousand, nine hundred to one thousand, nine hundred and thirty-five or thirty-six where it ended the journey with lindbergh lindbergh journey is a famous disaster which took place after that nobody builds zeppelin but our aim is not to discuss zeppelin in this particular context our aim is particu larly to discuss about aircraft but since aircraft c annot be considered as a separa te one from the flying vehicles please look at this notation here or nomenclature or annotations which we can use to understand our progress this one is about twenty meter wing span forty meter sixty meter eighty meter and one hundred meter an d similarly whichever is darkened it shows that group if we look at this one the wright flyer w right flyer in the wingspan less than twenty or within the twenty and it has one seat if it is that one seat shows that it is one to five passenger to carry or includi ng pilot to carry so that is the reason wright flyer has one seat and within this twenty meter wingspan s o slowly it is diffi cult to name each and every one one after another if we look back after in one thousand, nine hundred and five it is mentioned actually it was in one thousand, nine hundred and three refer sl ide time one thousand, two hundred and fifty-nine so after that there is quite good progress and from there it goes to a notable point we come across about the fokker more popularly known as fokker aircraft or red baron\u2019s fokker i t has three lifting surfaces and it looks very good but though now it is not being used because of man y other technical disadvantages i t also comes within the twenty meter wingspan and also within the one to five seating capacity and then slowly after that the development of helicopter starts in the year around say ing it is one thousand, nine hundred and twenty-three the first successfu l rotorcraft was conceptualized was built on laboratory and then if you look at this that a spirit of st louis is the next fixed wing aircraft s o in general we categorize the aircraft in two groups o ne we say fixed wi ng and the other we say the rotary wing and one more mixed thing is there but there are not many aircraft t he last successful one we will come across about v22 osprey but there are dif ficulties in control management controller design so that is not much popular s o if we look at the progress the notable point here it is mentioned as st louis as spirit of st louis which is having a capacity of within five and wing span of twenty meter t hen this cierva c30 is the first rotary wing aircraft which was flown and it was a kind of autogyro consideration was considered their design based on auto gyro it was having though it is not very wise to compare the blade span of a rotary wing aircraft with th e fixed wing aircraft wingspan but just for comparison it is noted here that it is about fifteen meter span next notable point is about b314 before that i think it is worth to mention this boeing two hundred and forty-seven also b oeing two hundred and forty-seven which is in the year if we look at about one thousand, nine hundred and thirty-three is the first aircraft where w e saw that it is all meta l body retractable landing gear fast aircra ft and that was very successful means it has been used in second worl d war in many ways many times but again anyway if we look at if we go further boeing three hundred and fourteen which we have some data here which is about wingsp an in the range of sixty meter and it s capacity is i think within one hundred this one is twenty-one to one hundred and then if we go further we have the sikorsky series s ikorsky series is famous for its helicopter mostly from the russian side so s ikorsky s55 which is having a blade or rotorcraft span of about fifteen meter then if we move further it is the notable poin t we come across is about piper t his is another piper or more popularly known as cherokee piper is very famous for its mass production and popularity and now sti ll it is being used for the robotic purpose for different clubs by different clubs so piper pa pa28 or c herokee comes within the wingspan of twenty meter and it has a capacity of within ten ten passengers including the pilot s o next if we look at that is this bristol one hundred and ninety-two bristol one hundred and ninety-two is having is a rotorc raft having two contra rotating sorry i am not very sure about whether contra rotating or not two rotary wing helicopter and it is from boeing this reference is for boeing ch47 ch47 may be traced here i am not able to trace it here at this point but more popularly known as a chinook s eries which is still continuing so with that we move forward with the big jumbo jet that is boeing seven hundred and forty-seven it is most popular for its wide body design and it has a huge capacity more than five hundred passenger capacity and a wingspan of about eighty meter and it has a capacity as i mentioned already it is more than one hundred definitely it is more than one hundred and it is having a capacity of around five hundred t hen if we look at to the further deve lopment f16 f 16is a fighter aircraft definitely it does not have much seating capacity but it is famous for its agile nature most advanced control and its flexibility in maneuvering then if we go for that avanti piaggio p180 that is also within th e one hundred and fifty but these two are tw o different class if we look at all the three if you look at this is the biggest aircraft till some date and then this is the most agile aircraft at that time and this is in the group of business jet that is coming there and th en if we go further business jet category is much popular in the business community nowadays and if we go further this is the most famous cargo aircraft we will see more photographs in our next lecture a n225 then another stealth aircraft that is b2 stealth t his is having a wingspan of about sixty meter a nd definitely it is fighter one so it is within the one to five pilots or passengers or co pilots including everyone and then another recent milestone we see is about a380 which is having about five hundred and twenty-five passenge r capacity and well within the airport requirement we have already mentioned here then this is a worth mention aircraft recent one developed in the year two thousand and ten that is cessna three hundred and fifty engine wise it is a different engine aircraft based on engine aircraft but it has a very good utility or purpose in a small range and w ith a lower capacity of passenger its two to four seater designs are available refer slide time two thousand and forty-eight now these are the huge range of aircraft available or have been developed in our industry w e have seen but if we look at this slide this slide predominantly considers this slides displays the engineering departments of an aerospace company s o the development can be divided in many ways but the design process if we look at the first and fore most design process is the preliminary design section so each and every aircraft accordi ng to the requirement of the client according to the requireme nt for which it is to be served preliminary design section designs it in a preliminary way w hat shoul d be the configuration what type of engine it should be or what should be the wing position but whe re the engine should be mounted all those things are decide d by preliminary design section t hen it goes f or the technical analysis group technical analy sis groups consist of aerodynamic groups structures group weight and balance control group power plant analysis group materi als and process group controls analysis group then one more big section is there that is kn own as component design section la boratory test section flight test section engineering field service section s o it is a kind of chronology fol lowed if we look at the preliminary design section gives it to the technical analysis section and which consists of as i said aerodynamic str uctures weight balance power plant materials controls so these are the basic sub categories on which the design is carried out and then each and every detail ed design phase we say the component design section that means this goes the overall design a nd then the component level design group like in structures design group they design each and every part of the wing will see how mu ch detail is required to design body and control surfaces system design group all mechanical hydraulic electrical an d thermal installations it designs and depending on all these detail ed design s things are get assembled and then it goes to the laboratory test section so in the wind tunnel these are tested wind tunnel and fluid mechanics test labs they test each an d every after assembl y all these aircraft and parts in structural test group t est for its structural strength propulsion test lab test it for propulsion capability electronic test l ab test the part of electronics electromechanical test groups also is involved in this process w eapons and control groups test the weapons portion separately and then after all these tests carried out in the laboratory it goes to the flight test section in the flight test section in flight all these components are again tested then again engineering field service section which looks at the service conditions required for an aircraft refer slide time two thousand, four hundred and twenty-seven now see those are the sections and parts which are involved in the develop ment of aircraft in an industry but we are in the structures course and we are supposed to look at the structure side how it takes care about the design s o before we go for any design it is necessary to look at what load it encounters so that is the first thing the applied loads once t he loads are determined it goes to the stress analysis and then definitely it has to come across the dynamic analysis there is one more research group which a lways think of the new concepts so let us try to see more in detail t he applied load calculat ion groups are the group which calculates loads from aerodynamics forces power plants aircraft inertia control system actuator launching and recovery gear and armaments so if we go in very brief in this sense the aerodynamic force is definitely the l ift force on the wing and on other surfaces for stability the p ower plant yes this power plant is imp ortant this thrust only makes it fly s o that total thrust has to be transferred to the fuselage there should not be any anomalies the aircraft inertia for any movement in any dynamic condition the inertia becomes much very important so that has to be calculated inertial force c ontrol system actuator that means while any control surface is deflected say for banking ailerons are deflected that creat es differential stress on the total aircraft or if a rudder is applied it also creates that so launching and recovery gear this is some kind of special gears in navy versions we usually use it instead of that in general the landin g gear is used an d the armament armament really is a thin g we generally do not visualize just think about the missile which is getting detach ed from the wing of an aircraft a s soon as the missile is detached it creates a n asymmetry of load and that has to be en countere d by the total aircraft now all these things are how the loads are coming on the a ircraft that has to be analyzed s o the stress analysis group or the str ess analysis and strength group they design each and individual part t hey think of the material a nd its thickness size and cross section of every structural member joints and connections of such members so these are some of the important things they decide they analyze they fix it dynamics analysis group takes care of the vibration and shock flutter probably you are not very introduced with it but scope in this course is also not much f lutter is something say couple phenomena with aerodynamic load and the structure and inertia and we have to have a flutter clearance for each and every aircra ft and the establishment of design requirements or chang e for its control or correction so dynamics group look at the establishment of design requirement s and change for its control or correction s pecial projects and research groups these usually look for new material use like the advanced laminated com posite materials a dvanced laminated composite material has become very popular becaus e of its high specific strength and it reduces weight but as well as it gives us the required strength to provide all requirements from a structural point of view analysis of new concept that means how new materials or a new way of fabricati on or design can be carried out the research group takes care of that replacement of components with new technology this is real ly going on now m ost of the aircraft components wherever possible are getting replaced from metal to plastic composite refer slide time two thousand, nine hundred and twenty-five this todays lecture has been taken or prepared from materials from wikipedia materials from megson mater ials from bruhn donaldson rivello or wesley peery azar refer slide time two thousand, nine hundred and forty-eight so if we look at the conclusion slide what we have learned in todays lecture that is the history of aircraft development and how does the development or fabrication of aircraft is taken care in the industry history of a flying vehicle with the timeline we have seen in a very brief way a payload from one passenger to two hundred and fifty ton that is the notable point we should look at range and endurance from one hundred and twenty feet or twenty second s to endless as we have mentioned in your first or second slide thus i feel how an aircraft industry works with these things i would l ike to conclude todays lecture t hank you for attending todays lecture and wish to meet you again with our next phase of the lecture t hank

anup ghosh from aerospace engineering iit kharagpur we are in continuation of the week four lectures in that series in the total seque nce the lecture number is twenty we will learn castigl ianos theorem today that is very very popular and this is sometimes it is said it is a variation of the different energy methods only but let us we will try to establish the equation first and then we will solve a few example refer slide t ime zero one hundred and six before we start anything as usual we are supposed to recapitulate things in this recapitulation we have done history of aircraft and aerospace structural analysis various types of external loads conceptual structural details flight envelope and load factor we have done shear and moment on wing and fuselage of an aircraft has also been covered we have al so done truss plane truss and also space truss or the space structures we have solved and in last three lectures we have considered with many examples dummy load method and unit load method and in this week class will or this lecture we will try to unde rstand or solve the series sorry castigli anos theorem and let us start that refer slide t ime zero two hundred and one so castiglianos theorem is the main topic let us try to cover refer slide t ime zero two hundred and five so castigli anos theorem let us try to establish first we are considering again one bar axially loaded by p of length a sorry length l and cross section a just load deflection curve is shown here now the strain energy for a linear elastic body strain energy is equal to half p delta strain energy per unit vol ume we did not really define as half of sigma into epsilon and if we put those values of half sigma and epsilon that gives us the value as it goes to p square l by a twice a considering application of two loads p one and p two one after another we may have t hree different scenario in one first case that p one is applied first p two next p two is applied first p one next and in the last case both are applied simultaneously so let u s see how the energy changes or how what is the net amount of energy and what is the r elation between those energies so in the first case let us say it is a p one first p two second so p one first means half of p one delta one p two comes next because of that the displacement is delta two that is half p two delta two but p one remains in the system that is the reason work done is done by that p one is equals to p one delta similarly if we go for the second one the p two first and p one second half p two delta two for the first half p one delta one for the second one and then p two remains that is why p two and the second displacement is delta one similarly if we go for the second necessary loads acting simultaneously that means p one plus p two is creating a displacement delta one plus delta two this scenario is depicted here in this with delta one p one corresponding to delta one p two corresponding to delta two the sequence is not shown there may be more many figures for that but i think these are easy and usually you can guess it so to do that you multiply those quantities and we see that behalf of p one delta one plus half of p two delta two plus half of p one delta one plus p two delta one we get the total load now since we have a relation between the displacement and the applied load delta one is equals to p l by ae delta one is equals to p one l by ae delta two is equals to p two l by ae from this relation we c an easily find that that delta one by p one is equals to delta two by p two now if we use this relation if we do simple there were a little bit with this three e relation you can easily prove that you may consider that as a home assignment is it you can easily prove that this is the u a u b and u c are the same that means the sequence is not important while we apply the load strain energy does not depend on the order on which loads are applied refer slide t ime zero five hundred and fifty-five consider a homogeneous isotropic linear elas tic body in equilibrium under the action of external forces p one p two and so on as p n when these loads act on the body they will do external work and some strain energy say u is stored in the body now let the load p n be increased by an amount delta p n t his is important the strain energy will increase and hence the total final strain energy will become u because of those what is stated here and plus because of delta p n and delta p n is multiplied by the change rate of change due to delta p n p n that is the reason the del u delta p n is the gradient multiplied by the delta p n so if we reverse the order as we have done in the previous case of application of the load that is if we apply delta p and f irst and then the loads p one p two to p n the final e nergy will remain unchanged that we have already proved let the deflection of the body in the direction of p n when delta p n is applied is equals to delta n small delta or variation small variation of delta of capital delta applying the load in revers e order what do we have following the previous concept what we have done that this is half of delta p n delta n and this is because the delta n is created by the inset of loads and that increases this and they energy you what we are not explicitly writing it because this was existing this is coming extra where delta n is the deflection on that p n now neglecting the small terms that means this particular term this is very very small both are very very small amount and if we neglect that so you f is equal s to delta p n capital delta n plus u is equals to this one because in the previous case energy is this and that leads to that capital delta n is equals to del u by p n where u is the strain energy in equilibrium configuration the deflection of any elas tic this is known as the castigl iano\u2019s second theorem we will see the theorems in the next slide the deflection of any elastic structure in the direction of load acting on it is equal to the partial derivative of the total strain energy with respect to th e load refer slide t ime zero nine hundred and twenty-nine so the second theorem as let us read first then we will read the first one del u by del qi the partial derivative of the complementary strain energy with respect to any independent generalized force qi is equal to the generalized displacement small qi located at the force qi and in the direction qi so these two things are very very important located at the force qi and in the direction qi so with that it is better to see and this because we consider why do we sa y the statement with respect to complementary energy first because we have seen in the first lecture of this w eek at this model that if the relationship is is not linear it is not linear elastic the derivation partial derivation of complementary energy giv es the displacement not the strain energy so that is the reason we say that first and then for a linear elastic body as it is mentioned here we can consider that del u del q capital q i is equals to small qi displacement in the ith position in the direct ion of applied load q i is small qi so following that things we can also prove in a different way that is not in the scope of the study so we may refer advanced books for this but let us learn that first theorem del u del qi is equals to small qi or the derivation with respect to the displacement gives as the force for a stable system the partial derivative of strain energy with respect to any independent generalized displacement qi is equal to the generalized force qi located at the displacement qi and in the direction of qi so with this it is just opposite to that so it is easy to remember the first theorem now it is an important point to note here that the dummy load method and unit load methods are special method for solving deflection analysis pro blems and they follow identically the castigli anos theorem so we this not e if you look at it if you solve the problems carefully if you look at it in many times you will understand you will have the idea that these methods are not much different but it is some variation of one is the some variation of the other refer slide t ime one thousand, three hundred and thirteen so let us solve a problem but the problem is again a cantilever beam in the cantilever beam there are two loads applied at the tip one is vertically upward p and a moment n so it is asked that that what is the vertical deflection of point a as well as what is the slope at that point since m is there and since p is present there we need not to apply any dummy load or unit load we if we consider derivative with resp ect to p or the energy we will get the vertical deflection if we consider a partial deri vative with respect to the m we wi ll get that slope so that is in th is example is not very tough it i s the easy to understand and it explains the method very well b ut what i would suggest that in the last three lectures whatever problems we have solved using dummy load method and unit load method you better try to solve those methods using castigli anos theorem let us solve this one again this as i have mentioned a t any section as it is given here a section which is x apart x is measured from this portion the moment is this p x and m and it is simply that u is m square by two ei for deflection what we have done we have considered as i mentioned for deflection it is v ertical upward deflection and in that direction p is applied so there is no problem we are simply directly con considering derivative of partial derivative of that energy and we get that one by e i equals to zero to l m x del m x del p dx so while we while we s ubstitute this values m x p x is the derivative value this x and this is m x and then if we integrate it we get that pl cube by tr i ei and ml square by twice ei is the deflection so if we solve without the m we generally get this value and this is the contribution of m that is quite clear so for the slope before we go for the slope better we try to draw it so this is the slope we are trying to find out and this is the deflection what we are trying to find out and then we see what is done here then to obtain the slope at the end we calculate the partial derivative of the strain energy with respect to the couple m which keeps theta equals to del u del m and m x del m del m x del m is there and that gives us since this is there is only one will come so n o point nothing is mentioned yet only a mx is present here and that is integrated and it gives that l square by two pl square by twice ei ml by ei so with that example we conclude todays lecture of castigli anos theorem and as i have suggested already you please better try to solve the other problems what are covered in the last examples in last lectures to solve these equations refer slide t ime one thousand, seven hundred and nineteen so next slide is a simple repetition of the references refer slide t ime one thousand, seven hundred and twenty-seven and after that we have one slide what we have learnt today that is castigliano\u2019s theorem that also comes in the energy method and we will follow in next class the rayleigh ritz method and i thank you for attendi ng this class the next class we wi ll learn the rayleigh rit z method

{"audio_filepath": "/media/rishu/Data1/Code Playground/test_ai4b/wav/21.wav", "duration": 1415.57, "text": "enty-one rayleigh ritz method so welcome back to aircraft structures course aircraft structures one this is professor anup ghosh from aerospace engineering iit kharagpur we are in the 4th week lecture series and that is why the module four and the lecture in sequence is twenty-one we will get introduced to the method rayleigh ritz method rayleigh ritz method is really very very import ant it is difficult to say how important it is it is important because probably these lays down the process of approximate analysis and as a whole it lays down the process of computer based numerical methods so as such you wo uld not find any link to tho se methods most popularly known as in structural or solid mechanics as finite element method but it has correlations it will you will get introduced to it slowly as far as i can i will try to give you those glimpses at this stage it is difficult to discus s those things but i will try my best to give you those introduction so with that idea we will we will try to cover the rayleigh method with one small example refer slide t ime zero two hundred and five so let us proceed with the next slide which is as usual a recapitu lation slide in this slide what we see is that we have already covered aircraft and aerospace structures analysis history of those we have covered various types of external loads conceptual structural details we have covered the flight envelope and load factor how the flight does the fight envelop looks like and why it is so and how the load factor varies we have seen with examples shear and movement coming to wing and fuselage considering a typical example we have seen truss and truss in the sensor it comes always plane truss but we have seen also space truss or space structures and we have solved a few examples related to that especially the landing gear problems and then we got introduced to energy methods and in that sequence we have already don e a dummy load or unit load method and unit load method and castiglianos theorem today we will do the rayleigh ritz method refer slide t ime zero three hundred and twenty-five so in the rayleigh ritz method it is better to understand that it is an approximate method refer slide t ime zero three hundred and thirty-four first keeping in mind that idea let us try to understand it is it is a very brief way explained it is explained or discussed as brief as it can be because it is getting introduced for the first time there are big books on these methods to do as we have already discussed that these and some other methods like the variational principle along with this method lays down the probably the first step for the numerical analysis procedure in terms of say structural analysis or solid mechanics pro blems or for fluid mechanics problems or for any other numerical analysis depending on the magnetism or other physics problems so let us see try to understand each and every word of what is said here so the method approximates the continuum it is a con tinuous system where continuity of all the variables what we are considering that is persisting by a system with a finite number of degrees of freedom this says a lot as i said so in we will discuss always in purview of solid mechanics structural analysis so what we are considering that a structure which is as such as having a continuity or it is a continuum is broken down to finite number of degrees of freedom in our solid mechanics we consider the degrees of freedom as displacements and in general we need to define those displacements as functions and we need to carry out those so that is the first step it says that it is an approximate method because it is getting divided in finite numbers of degrees of freedom it is not a continuous one thus the solutions of the differential equations of equilibrium are approximated by a system of simultaneous algebraic equations so that i s what as i was discussing these degrees of freedom there may be many or may be repetition for considering small parts but tho ugh it is repetition for different boundary conditions it will give different values and definitely it will be easier to get simultaneous algebraic equations and we need to solve those simultaneous algebraic equations to find out the approximate solution the method is particularly useful for statically indeterminate problems in which an exact solution is often intractable so it is it is especially means it can it has a capability of solving indeterminate problem because the solution approach does not ta ke care of whether it is a determinant or indeterminate problem in bigger senses while you will be using this you will find that the all the problems what in general we solve for practical purpose those are indeterminate problem statically indeterminate pr oblem so from the principle of minimum potential energy functional the equilibrium is given by this capital pi shows that the total potential energy and it also says that a variation of it or a small change if i do not talk about in mathematical terms in physical terms if we talk about see by some means if we consider a small change of the functional here the total potential energy so that remains that leads to a value of zero and that that is the fundamental equation and we need as we have already introdu ced finite number of degrees of freedom and it will lead to simultaneous equation this equation will lead to these segmentalian equations considering depending upon the degrees of freedom we choose and how do we choose the problem remains how the degree s of freedom describes the problem properly and that is the way we get the solution we will consider this in this lecture and also in the lecture followed by this two problems one in this lecture other one in the followed problem you will find depending u pon the assumption of the degrees of freedom of variable description it depends the accuracy though for there are limitations for hand calculations so we will find approximate solutions or if pi is a function of n generalized displacements q i as i have a lready mentioned here the degrees of freedom or displacements as it is mentioned then pi may be expressed as function of qi to q two to q n and then this is nothing but with respect to each and every displacement variable we are considering variation or in m athematical terms we say that it is the partial derivative with respect to that particular displacement and each and every particular partial derivative equation will lead to one equation so we will get n equations that is what is said simultaneous algeb raic equations we will get and if we solve those n equations we can find out some approximate solution and we get benefited by this so let us move forward it is one more definition of the system in a little bit different way let us try to see what is tha t definition refer slide t ime one thousand and six so a general linear deformable system can be described by displacement u x y z v x y z and w x y z which must satisfy the compatibility equilibrium and boundary conditions compatibility what is compatibility pr obably were not introduced that way compatibility is that while we are considering this variable from one segment to the other it must maintain the relation between these so the strain has to be compatible or otherwise it will show the property of contin uum equilibrium definitely it has to maintain a equilibrium equilibrium equations we will do in the fifth week class so compatibility probably is covered in the sixth week class and boundary conditions in rayleigh ritz method definitely boundary condi tion has to be satisfied in rayleigh ritz method we write the displacements as u a i f i summation of i one to n summation of i equals to one to n a i f i x y z g i x y z where the coefficient is b i here the coefficient is c i and we define w so actually w which is anyone say w is function of x y z we also define that that is an equation where we have one more coefficient c i and the function and a function h i which is also a function of x y z where f i g i and h i functions of x y z are assumed a priory this plays a very very important role we need to have an idea what type of function we should assume for f g and h it depends on the problem this is the key of the approximate method infinite element analysis this is conforming i should not say exactl y it is conforming or similar probably to the shape functions of an element so like that we need to assume this a priory because we need to know what problem we are going to solve is it a displacement problem it is a stress problem or some other propert y we are going to solve so depending on that we need to consider and not only that what degree of accuracy we want to consider whether it is linear which is non linear depending on all those things this compatibility equilibrium and boundary conditions w ill change and accordingly these functions will change so this function play a big role in that they must satisfy kinematic or geometric boundary condition but not necessarily the stress boundary condition so it has to satisfy the kinematic boundary co ndition and but it is not always necessary to satisfy the stress boundary condition but it is sometimes desirable to solve to maintain that a i b i c i are coefficients that we need to find out otherwise the functions we are saying assuming so the unknow ns are a i b i c i only so we need to find out those so what we are considering again variation we are considering of the total potential energy and that gives us three partial differential segments in this equations which are del pi del a i del pi del b i del pi del c i then assuming that a i b i c i are linearly independent variables it concludes that that then the above equation is satisfied if and only if individually these are zero so that gives us n equations n equations and n equations so we h ave three n equations we have three n unknowns as we have done and this simultaneous equations algebraic equations we are supposed to solve and we are supposed to find out but see for hand calculation it is not possible to solve that is the reason we will solve small problems probably considering one or two variables but principally it is the same so for a set of linearly independent simultaneous equation that can be solved for a i b i and c i there so let us move for the example and try to understand how this method has been applied refer slide t ime one thousand, five hundred and fifty-one example statically determinate problem this problem is quite known problem you have you can easily solve this problem using the methods what we have already described those are like castiglian os principle or unit load method dummy load method all those things are complementary energy function derivative method all those things you can easily do so the boundary conditions are w zero equals to zero and w l is also equals to zero that means we are supp osed to assume the function w such that at this point it is equals to zero as well as at this point it is equals to zero the w x is supposed to be like something like this and it also has to satisfy the moment boundary condition here that is the m zero is equals to zero and m l is equals to zero as we know that double derivative of w with respect to the x as it is said from the center line sorry from the center line the ei del two w del x square is equals to zero following this and following this we get that this is that is also equals to zero so we need to assume w such that it satisfies all these four boundary conditions these two as well as these two so now we are assuming it it requires some experience do not think that it may be assumed with two days practice or maybe one years experience of solving problem so the problem is assumed w x sorry the solution or that displacement function is assumed as w x equals to summation of i equals to one to n a i sin i pi x by l so sin function is quite it matches well let us see how goo d how good is our approximation to the exact solution it satisfies boundary conditions the potential energy total potential energy is pi is equals to u plus v and u what we have already seen this one so that has to be its simple derivation is considere d here and from zero to l as usual from zero to l it is integrated and or square all those things i hope that you will be able to carry out this and finally we get the strain energy as u is equals to l ei by four summation i equals to one to n i pi by l whole to the power four a i square refer slide t ime one thousand, nine hundred and ten potential energy pe of the external load in the deflected equilibrium is v so we need to find out that portion also the portion v of the total potential energy so that comes definitely minus of load into di splacement that is what is given here p zero x the uniformly distributed load and the displacement function w x what we have considered so it is integrated that way it is written the same way it is written twice just to avoid confusion and then integration is carried out that gives us that v is equals to minus of 2l by pi p zero a i by l sum summed up over one to n for i equal value of one to n and then the total potential energy partial derivative with a i is considered if we consider with respect to a i this is this portion as well as a i is partial derivative is considered so and the previous one if we consider it if you step jumps are there you can easily get that i guess so summing up of u and v and taking the partial derivative with a i gives us this relati on and that is equals to zero and this gives us that a i is equals to four p zero l to the power four divided by pi to the power five i to the power five ei and then once we have the value of a i the a priori assumed displacement function w w x is equals to four p zero l to the power four divided by pi to the power five ei summation over i equals to one to n and one by i to the power five sin i pi x by l the convergence of the above series is rapid you can easily test it probably by this time you have requires some skill of numerical or co ding you can easily do a coding to find out how first it get converges so that you can easily do but in this work what we have considered only consider the first term and if we consider the first term what we have at l by two putting the value of x equals to l by two we have the deflection central reflection here as one hundred and thirty-one p zero l to the power four by ei and you please note that this is the exact value one hundred and thirty which is nothing but five by three hundred and eighty-four p zero l to the power four by ei so with the first term only it is quite accurat e right so with other terms you can easily check how quickly it converges and how accurately we get the solution this point it is good to note that since our a priori assumption of w x y is very very close to the actual deflection curve this curve is a sine curve that is the reason we are able to able to get almost the exact solution with first term only so it depends on the assumption of the basic variable what we are considering or assuming and that way it depends on the solution so with this i hope a very very important method in solid mechanics is introduced rayleigh method you may have a look in detail in some from some advanced books definitely will get enlightened and you will learn a lot refer slide t ime two thousand, three hundred and twenty-nine so we proceed further w ith to the standard reference page refer slide t ime two thousand, three hundred and thirty-five and from there we come to the conclusion page the energy methods of structural analysis and the rayleigh ritz method we have discussed here hope you have understood to some extent for further things you please refer to the advanced books basically for those analysis and thank you for attending this particular lecture we will proceed further for indeterminate problem solving thank you"}

course this is professor anup ghosh fro m aerospace engineering department of iit kharagpur we are at the last lecture of fourth week or module four in series the lecture number is twenty-two we will solve a few problem of statically indeterminate structures in this problem solving will be you following you may say the complementary energy method stationary problem or say castiglianos theorem method or and we will solve using dummy load method and we also will be solving one example with rayleigh ritz method refer slide t ime zero one hundred and fourteen so all these met hods are already introduced to you and we will will see how those methods are applied for problem solving in indeterminate structures as a recapitulation already we have covered many things history of aircraft and solid mechanics or structural analysis various types of external loads experienced by the aircraft structures flight envelope the value of n how it varies the load factor we have considered we have seen how the moment varies on wing or on fuselage because of the load for a typical example we have solved we in energy methods we have solved various methods as it is listed during this week in the last few lectures that is dummy load method unit load method castiglianos theorem and rayleigh ritz method refer slide t ime zero two hundred and ten so now we will proceed further to solve the indeterminate structures refer slide t ime zero two hundred and twelve in indeterminate structures our first example is a very very simple truss example this truss example is first thing we should see that it is in an indeterminate struc ture and how it is indeterminate and how can we take care of the indeterminancy statically determinate structure this truss there are two truss members this thing is repeated i think twice even then there is no harm in repeating because this very easy que stions are frequently asked m three equals to two j is the statically determinate internally m is the number of members three is the reactions external reactions and 2j number of joints multiplied by two if it is greater than the net indeterminate if it is less it is unstable structure so where m is the number of members three is the externally unknown reactions and j is the number of joints following this formula here m is equals to six j is equals to four one two three four five six one two three four number of indeterminancy is six three eight is equals to one three is because it is a plane truss we have equations three equations equilibrium equations and then it gives us that there is only one internal indeterminacy so in that sense if we remove either this diagonal or this diagonal this structure remains stable but it becomes determinate structure somebody may ask why not this or this maybe this one is possible to remove but this one if we remove that then also it is possible but it depends on your ease of work how do you want to proceed so in this par ticular example we will we will remove this diagonal and we will assume that it is a tension force acting in that member of magnitude r let bd be the redundant member r is the tensile force in the member bd due to external r is the tensile force in the m ember bd due to external load the total complementary energy pi c as we have done many times that is individual force and the variation of the force if we integrate that lambda i df i from zero to a f i equals to one to k minus this is the external energy ind uced into it so that complementary energy what we have is for equilibrium of total complementary energy has a stationary value if we consider with respect to the r variation and we get the equation this way and where lambda is equals real equation of or contraction of ith member due to the external load and that gives us the equation in this form one by ae i equals to one to k f i l i del f i del r equals to zero refer slide t ime zero five hundred and fifty-seven so with that understanding following the procedure of tables solving th is type of problems truss problems we are quite familiar with the process what we will do we will try to find out the deflection in that particular or the equation in that particular member as it is given in the previous page so the component f del f del r and f l del f del r all these components are calculated and what do we have is that this is this loads you can easily find out i have not elaborated those loads how do you find out removing considering the member force r and external force p better y ou solve the problem that portion is kept here if we solve the problem it becomes that for ab which is of length l is minus r by root two and it goes sequentially for different members there is no point of reading each and every members member forces but the point to note that it is this column is derivative partial derivative with respect to the r so this gives minus one by root two one by root two one by root two one by root two this is one because r is coefficient one here also it is one and then we do this multiplicati on and do the summation of all these columns and that leads to that four hundred and eighty-three rl two thousand, seven hundred and seven pl is equals to zero and from there we get the value of r again one more job is left for you to do you can have one more column here if we substitute the value of r you can e asily find out the forces in this member so the redundant force is first found out that is minus of fifty-six p we assume tension it has become a compression because it is minus so substituting sun of r value in column f will result in to the force forces i n all the members hope you will complete this problem let us proceed for the next problem to solve refer slide t ime zero eight hundred and thirty-nine this is an one more example of indeterminate structure here we will be following unit load method it is a cantilever beam but there are two supports at one at an two at one at and two which is uniformly under uniformly distributed load p zero this one and two are equidistant apart that is l by two and l by two and since there are roller supports only vertical reactions are to be consi dered so the total number of unknowns here are five three here though we do not have any force in the x direction but we have that equation we have that unknowns if we have some inclined force then they definitely x will become the unknown so there are five unknowns and the indeterminacy if we see in that sense the number of indeterminacy is two because we have five unknowns the above structure is an externally indeterminate structure externally please note it previous things whatever we were discussing all those were internally indeterminate structure this is externally because from support point of view from stability or external equilibrium point of view it has more than the necessary support from the available global equilibrium equations sum of m equals to zero sum of x f x equals to zero sum of f y equals to zero is not it is not possible to determine five reactions let us assume the two redundant reaction forces are the two vertical support reactions at one and two these are the two redundant forces so redundant densi ty is that indeterminate and redundancy this term is also used sometime redundant supports are those supports if we remove those supports after removal of the support salsa structures remains externally stable while we remove the supports the displaceme nts of those points do not change that has to be maintained two displacement boundary conditions for the problems are delta one and delta two delta one is here delta two is here is equals to zero let us try to solve the problem using in unit load method we need to find out moments at any cross section also because sorry we need to find out moment at any cross section so let m zero x is moment at any section due to imposed loads and reactions r one and r two are considered there so this is what m zero is calculated whil e we are considering that r one is present r two are present instead of considering those as suppo rts we are saying that those are some loads support reaction loads are applied and we are supposed to find out the m zero x m naught x and m one is the moment due t o the unit load applied to find out the deflection let us see how do we proceed with help of figure refer slide t ime one thousand, two hundred and thirty-two as we have mentioned in the previous one m zero x and m one x already we have mentioned so we if we refer to this figure if we co nsider a section here the moment is equals to r one multiplied by x that i s what is there minus of it and it is considered this way minus and the other way the p zero the uniformly distributed load comes in this direction and that is considered plus so p zero x square by two is that load so it is from here to here we calculate the moment and then for the m zero x the limit for here from here to here that is l by two to l we have one more force r two that is what this is added by this r two but here the effective length is different x l by two is put there so moment is found out for r one and r two we need to find out moment for unit loads and we need to form equations and we need to solve there are two unknowns r one and r two so we need to at least have two equations to solve it so this is the first case we are considering all other loads are removed only unit load one is applied at the tip and because of that moment is very simple it is minus x wherever you go it is minus x increases with x from zero to l and then it is m zero m one with two limits it is put i can meticulously put that this is brought down here minus x is there and then again minus x and this is what down here and we need to carry out the integration hope this simple integration you can carry out easily refer slide time one thousand, four hundred and thirty-seven so if we carry out the integration we get the first equation involving r one and r two delta one is equals to zero we can put here or we can put later in this process delta this equation is equated to zero later we need to have one more equation so for that this is the second figure here all other loads are removed only unit load is applied at position two and for that this is there is no moment that i s what it is equals to zero and m one x is equals to x l by two so that is what is the moment here a nd as usual this equation is put in this equation to find out delta two integrated from zero to l this first portion is zero there is nothing so this portion becomes zero only remaining portion is this one and we get the delta two is equals to this value refer slide time one thousand, six hundred and eight so now we put the boundary condition delta one and delta two equals to zero it is written in matrix form you may not write the matrix forms you can simply solve the equation and if you solve the equations we get that r one is equals to e eleven p zero l by fifty-six and r two equals to twelve p zero l by twenty-one to calculate the rotation at the end one we need to apply that this much is solved so the unknown forces are known r one and r two are known but one more question has been asked in this problem to solve what is the rotat ion here it is from may be some deflection so it may be a following a deflection line something like that the rotation here has been also asked what is that value so let us try to find out that for that what we need to do is that we need to apply a unit moment as it is shown here and for that moment similarly it is minus one for unit moment and we put those values and find out the integration and we get the solution theta is equals to p zero l cube by divided by three hundred and thirty-six ei so it is quite easy way to find out d eflections for determinate and indeterminate structure the indeterminate unit load method you can easily learn that well and apply it for further problem solving let us move forward to the next example refer slide t ime one thousand, nine hundred and two this is again in one ind eterminate problem and we will use the rayleigh ritz method to solve this here as we have already discussed in the previous example the a priori assumed function displacement function was very close to the exact one that is the reason with only one i equa ls to one or considering only the first term we get a very very close solution let us see what happens in this particular case so let us try to solve the problem this is a propped cantilever beam and under uniformly distributed load find the deflected s hape of the beam and the reaction at the roller support p zero is uniformly distributed load let us assume the shape of the deflection is w x equals to a one a two x a three x square a four x square so it is assumed that the reflection what it is shown here i s of will be following this function so this depends on how accurately we assume this function the accurate the solution we get so let us see the geometrical the geometric boundary conditions are displacement is zero at zero here slope is zero definitely slope is zero as i have also tried to draw the slope zero here and also displacement at this point is also equals to zero first the boundary condition this boundary condition if we implement that gives us that a one is equals to zero because all others are going zero a one is for second boundary condition if we implement that is the derivative so this also will become zero this is already zero that gives us this will become one so this a two will become zero and then the third one gives us a relation between a three and a four and that we hav e a three is equals to a four l so if you substitute those values our modified equation becomes w x equals to a four x square multiplied by x \u2013 l so with that consideration we try to find out let us try to find out the total potential energy and the total pote ntial energy becomes to do that the u and v we need to find out u is found out by integration zero to l m square by ei and this m is put here a double derivative of w partial derivative of w and that value we get this value hope this small steps you can ea sily do and after integration we get that u is equals to twice ei a four square l cube and energy due to the externally applied load p zero zero to l integration we do p zero w x as usual in the previous case also you have done and if we carry out that integration w e get that p zero l to the power four by twelve multiplied by a four now we are supposed to add these two and suppose to consider a variation with respect to a four refer slide t ime two thousand, three hundred and thirteen so to do that what we have done the total potential energy u v is calculate d here and then as i have said that variation with respect to a four or partial derivative of total potential energy has been found out and with that variation what we have is that if we apply that simple differentiation partial differentiation if we do it le ads to that a four equals to minus p0 l by forty-eight e i and w x becomes p zero l by forty-eight ei x square multiplied by x \u2013 l and the shear force if we can are able to find out at this that is nothing but the reaction here that is why the shear force has been has been fo und out which is nothing but negative of del m del x here d m dx so if we carry out that without m is equals to double derivative of the w function at x equals to l this steps you please carry out it is considered here x equals to l if we put we get that s hear force here the shear force or the reaction here is equals to p 0l by eight but please note that it is not very close to the exact solution this solution is three p zero l by eight that we can easily find out by unit load method or any other energy method for ind eterminate structure solution why it is not matching that is the reason thing i have tried to discuss it depends on the experience of the engineer who is analyzing it how close do you assume the function with respect to the displacement if you look bac k this function assumption finally this one with boundary condition no way describes this displacement closely and that is the reason we are not able to find out the exact solution in this way so either will have to consider the function properly or will have to think of doing experiments to get some variable or may be longer polynomials will have to take we need to consider other boundary conditions to find out those solutions and we will have to proceed so with all these example we would like to concl ude but i have a suggestion to the students that i have solved many problems with different methods so you can apply all the methods to all the problems and try your solution and check whether the solution is satisfactorily working for the other methods or not with that and note let us conclude today\u2019s lectures and we come to the end refer slide t ime two thousand, six hundred and forty-seven with energy method and inter and also in this lecture we have solved indeterminate problems so thank you for attending this lecture and we wil l start the theory of elasticity portion in our next week lecture thank you for attending"}

is professor anup ghosh from aerospac e engineering department iit kharagpur this is the first lecture of module five or week five the number in that series is lecture number twenty-three we will start theory of elasticity the first lecture consists of mainly the stress definition of stress and components of stresses correlation i would like to put on stress correlations with the previous things we have discussed and accordingly we will go forward this class is with simple thoughts of how to what is stress and how does it act where what are the components we wo uld not go much beyond but slowly in the future lectures we will start go into depth we will go into sometimes two dimensional stress sometimes three dimensional stress considerations will do and accordingly we will proceed for problem solving with that refer slide t ime zero one hundred and thirty-nine so the next slide what we see is that usual recapitulation slide in this slide we have already seen the history of aircraft solid mechanics structural analysis various types types of external loads conceptual structura l details we have seen what is flight envelopes and load factor is how do we need to restrict our design within the flight envelope shear and movement on wing and fuselage of an aircraft we have seen how does it act with a typical example we have solved that those problems unit load methods we have considered then we have gone to the truss and space structures especially the space structures we have covered there we have solved problems with landing gear interesting problems with landing gear prelim inary studies for landing gears are still done that way unless you have a facility of advanced computations but even then many times the way it has been analyzed considering axially loaded members the same way it is still solved for the first iteration then in detail design there are many other ways to do more detail cad drawings are prepared and accordingly boundary conditions are put to find out things that is also true in case of movement and wing moments on wing and fuselage but whatever we do you b etter note down that the thing what we will be learning today that you are already introduced with the stress components of stress in most of the cases you have solved problems in two dimension but our approach mainly is three dimension in some of the c ases where three dimensional approach is too complicated it is difficult to give you a proper understanding on those cases we will go for the two dimensional analysis and we will see how stresses are acting on a body what are the components how does it a ct where and how does it act all that is the main aim of this we will try to see some examples we will try to see how the stresses may act and we want to concentrate more about deflection what we have already covered in this the last bullet as you see here that dummy load unit load energy methods that is the dummy load consisting of dummy load unit load castiglianos theorem rayleigh ritz method all those comes under energy method in rayleigh ritz also we have considered energy it is not always the energy sometimes some other functional is also used but predominantly energy is considered but those things are not related to stress first of all better too note that in most of the cases we have found out the deflection deflection also is a design cr iteria it is not that only stresses are the predominant thing which we need to monitor say one good example i understand is that just try to visualize the wing of an aircraft and say during takeoff it is in most of the cases the civil aircrafts are are ma de such that the fuel is stored inside the wing and say if the fuel is stored inside the wing in that case the wing will definitely bend down now if the clearance is not proper the engine may start the ground or the clearance distance may reduce so that may create many other problems so deflection plays a big role not only that say when it is airborne the lift is acting upward on the wing and because of that it changes the normal angle of attack so in the deflected position what is the changed angle of attack that is also important so in that way deflection is important we will see how stress is important we have solved some problems in our mechanics related to stakes sorry stress in your in your previous courses they are probably you have covered t he course of mechanics engineering mechanics and there you have covered stresses but will re look into it will try to see what are the stresses how does it act refer slide t ime zero six hundred and fifty-nine so with those no tes initial nodes we will go further to see what is stress how does it act with those introduction to stress that is the reason we say we are starting the topic introduction to stress and we will go further refer slide t ime zero seven hundred and thirteen in this if we see definition and notation of stress this is the main topic in one or two slides we will be covering what we are considering here that an arbitrary separate body subjected to externally external applied forces p one to p n here it is up to shown p five it may be considered that it is up to p five a nd what we are co nsidering that inside it is not that this surface is perpendicular to this vector this delta the surface what is shown at o consisting of area delta a is perpendicular to delta p but what we are considering here that because of these external loads p one p two p three p four p five there is a resultant force acting which is delta p and that delta p is acting inside the body on the surface delta a which is located at o so for balance definitely there is one more force acting there if we separate it out both will act t o the two directions that is what is shown here if we consider the lower body and if we talk show that delta p is acting this way it has two components delta p n and delta p s this delta p n whenever this subscript n is there we consider that that is i n the direction to the normal to that surface n goes for normal to that surface and s is tangential to that surface delta s is tangential to that surface that is the reason we have two components of delta p one is delta p n and the other is delta p s so these two forces are acting on this area delta a so delta p resultant force on delta a in the plane n n stress this is the definition of stress please note that stress is equals to limit delta a tends to tends to zero del p by del a so from the definition of limit you have already learned in mathematics what we get that that is equals to the stress we denote that by sigma so if that is the stress sigma and what we see now as we have already considered that the vector delta p is resolved to two components delta p n and delta p s and it is in the direction normal to the surface it is in the direction tangent to the surface that we have written here we have written that normal components plus tangential component normal or direct stress will be there in th e next slide but before that let us consider an example of simply supported beam where we have a central load of p acting downward as p and the length of the beam we consider that is equals to l so at this we have reactions p by two we have reaction p by two and if we talk about the bending moment diagram bending moment diagram will be p by two multiplied by l by two is the this amplitude and this will become equals to pl by four and shear force if we talk about that will be oh sorry like this so what i want to mean with this example is that at any section if we consider this section and if we talk about if it is a rectangular cross section what are the forces we have we have bending moment say this is what is acting so on these we have external bending moment acting like this as well as we have shear force acting like this or in may be the other way direction is not important thing what we are considering now but what i want to mean that because of this there is a shear force acting in this plane as well as we have normal forces acting on this half as may be tension here and other half it may be compression if it is pa ss this way the other half is this way so this way it will create a combination of stresses which we need to find out so like that this bod y is considered as a simplest way the stress is what is acting there and accordingly we are trying to define the stress considering a simple force system refer slide t ime one thousand, three hundred and forty-five so let us move forward so what we have here is that normal or direct st ress sigma n n is equals to delta p n by delta l let me delta a tends to zero and sigma int sometimes tau n t is also used sigma and tau is freely used in this case but sometimes when not mentioned sigma is the normal stress and tau is the shear stress but it is not a very very necessary rule sometimes both are used for showing normal as well as shear stress so let stress in give is given by sigma ab or tau ab the first subscript a denotes the normal to the plane so like that here if we talk about on which the stress is acting so if we bring back the example of the beam and if we consider this is the axis x it is supported something like this and if we consider a rectangular cross section of the beam in that case the normal stress acting here will be sigma x x and the shear stress if we consider this is y this will be shear stress tau xy it is on x plane in the y direction so that is what is stated here the first subscript a denotes the normal to the plane on which the stress is acting the second subscrip t b denotes the direction of the stress x is on which plane it is acting y is along which direction it is acting sigma n n following that sigma n n is a stress normal stress acting on a plane denoted by its normal n some computer problem in the direction of the normal and sigma nt is the stress or shear stress acting on the plane denoted by the normal\u2019s in the transverse direction of the normal acting on the transverse direction of the normal or along the plane so repeatedly we have said probably you do not have any more confusion about it so according to the coordinate assumption of coordinate axis if we go for x y z axis considering say this is x this is y and this is z we will be following right hand screw system so following that x y and z is this way we can have different such components as it is shown in case of beam considering only the cross section of the beam as rectangular cross section we have two components but if the if the beam is loaded also transverse direction say something this way from this direction from the from me towards the board or from the board towards the me that means the j in z direction then definitely there will be components in that z direction and other forces also will come so those things we need to keep it in mi nd these stresses also will vary depending on the type of material we are considering it is not that always the sigma x remains same way it depends on the loading it depends on the type of material whether the material is isotropic or not whether the ma terial is composite or two different materials put together that type of beam or not or beam is the common example you have come across that is the reason we are i am trying to give you example of beam again and again so following that there may be many other components the components total number of components what we may get we will see so it may be observed that while the subscripts are the same that is a equals to b it is denoting a normal stress and while a is not equals to b it is a shear stress resultant stress as usual from vector rule what you say is amplitude is that sigma n n square plus tau nt square root of that those two sum of those two squares refer slide t ime one thousand, nine hundred and sixteen now we come to the state of stress at uniform stress condition so this is something better to note that uniform stress condition uniform stretch condition is difficult to prevail in practical cases so one example we may think at present some practical example is that say we have a cantilever beam and we have a proje ction something like this and one load is applied at the tip say p so in this particular case what will happen this may be replaced as a beam having whatever the length is say if this is the length l then this is a moment pl and one axial force p now an y cross section if we talk about of this is it is a rectangular cross section and as we have already mentioned there is a variation of stress due to the bending but this is there is no change of bending moment pl throughout the length of the beam and that remains same for the total length of the beam so that is a kind of uniform stress condition for the total structure we may talk about and in this particular slide or in the next slide we will consider that there is no change of stress at for that for the shake of definition so with that thing keeping in mind that thing this is one example how a material or structure may be stressed where the stresses are uniform is very rare it does not happen in general we need to think a lot to find out this type of c ase now what we are trying to do we are considering any point save of the beam for this particular case beam and in this beam definitely if we consider this beam a point this point is inside this beam then definitely we wo uld not have all the stress comp onents as it is shown here so we need to think about a structure which is loaded from all possible sides and inside that we are considering a point and that point is drawn as a cuboid as shown here now let us see about sign conventions and the force str esses acts on that particular point so if the outer normal to the plane is along the positive coordinate direction out turn normal say this normal in the positive coordinate direction and the direction of the stress component is also in the positive dire ction direction of this also in the positive direction this stress is positive stress so otherwise it is negative so what it is trying to say that if the normal is if i draw a normal on this particular plane say this plane that will definitely in this direction if that direction is matching with this direction as well as if the stress is also acting say stress is also acting but stress is also acting in the same direction then we are cons saying that that is equals to positive stress so similar way th is tau xy is also in case of shear it is acting in this y direction and acting on the plane which is a shown by a positive normal so this is positive this is also positive this is also positive so with that consideration if we look at that sigma x in thi s particular xx is positive tau xy acting on the plane x in the direction y tau xz acting on the plane x in the direction z as it is shown here is that if the outer normal to the plane is along the negative coordinate direction and the direction of the str ess is also in the negative direction coordinate direction this stress is positive stress so on the positive we have shown one more way the stress may be positive that way we need to consider this one this component of stress what is it says that norma l to the plane is along the negative direction this is the negative direction negative x direction and the direction of the stress stress is also in the negative direction direction of the stress that is this one is also on the negative direction so in that case we consider that sigma or the stress as positive stress so this is also positive stress this is also positive stress otherwise it is negative stress so in that way if we talk about we consider there are how many components we may think of we can think of that there are three orthogonal planes that is we can say x plane y plane z plane each are having three components so we have nine components of stresses so with this nine component of stresses the possible types of stresses possible variation o f stresses and how do they act is to some extent defined so to note again let let me briefly repeat what are the things coming these three are acting on x plane these are also acting on x plane but in the opposite direction this is and these are acting on y plane and one more we have that is this and these are acting on two z planes so in two directions it is acting so considering a cuboid in a point what we have shown that there are possible nine components of stresses and with those nine components of s tresses we let us move forward refer slide t ime two thousand, seven hundred and fifty-four so above figure is true this figure only only in the case of uniform stresses as i have already mentioned it is true for uniform cases one example of a similar type we have seen for uniform stress components generally incremented from one plane to the next with a normal distance of dx it is for non uniform stress please this is for non uniform stress for non uniform stress stress components are generally incremented from one plane to the next p lane with a normal distance of dx if sigma x is the stress on x plane it will be incremented as sigma x plus del sigma s del x which is the gradient and the length is multiplied at the dx distance apart it will be incremented this way so in the next le cture we will be considering equilibrium we will see how non uniform stress is considered and how these things are taken care at a plane dx distance apart from the x plane now stress at a point if we continue in that sense on three mutually perpendicular planes at a point there exist three components on each plane and a total number of nine components only that we have already seen how those things act and generally the total all the nine components is generally given by sigma ij here we also need to say th at where i j is equals to one two three so with this definition this sigma ij shows if i say only this and this these two completes the definition of all the nine components of stresses this is with respect to cartesian coordinate system it is given this is a cons idered sum coordinate system which is also orthogonal and named as one two three not x y z refer slide t ime three thousand and forty-six so with this no te we would like to complete the definition one more small note is there as it is mentioned in the previous slide that is the eac h element of sigma i j is called the stress components the nine components as a whole of sigma i j is called the stress tensor as we have said in the last like last slide the totality of these entities describing the state of stress at a point is indepen dent of coordinates this is called tens or the stress vectors at any plane may be expressed in terms of sigma i j through equilibrium condition so that is the next thing we will learn the equilibrium condition let us proceed refer slide t ime three thousand, one hundred and thirty-seven in that but before that i would like to thank you for attending this lecture and we will move forward for equilibrium analysis in the next lecture"}
{"audio_filepath": "/media/rishu/Data1/Code Playground/test_ai4b/wav/24.wav", "duration": 2309.5, "text": "enty-four theory of elasticity equilibrium welcome back to aircraft structures one course this is professor anup ghosh from aerospace engineering department iit kharagpur we are in the lecture of 5th week module five and we will see how the equilibrium equations are derived we are in the discussion of theory of elasticity which is very very fundamental of solid mechanics if we say and we have started in our last lecture about definition of stress in this lecture we will be considering the equilibrium condition so equilibrium has to maintain how mathematically we express the equilibrium in case of structural analysis or solid m echanics that we will learn without equilibrium probably nothing exist in case of our analysis also we will see how the stress gets connected with the equilibrium or external surface loads or body force so with that note let us proceed further refer slide t ime zero one hundred and forty-one before we proceed further as usual what we need to consider is that what we have learnt so far in a quick way we will say that we have learned a history of aircraft and structural analysis we have learned various types of external lo ads conceptual structural details flight envelope load factor shear and movement on wing and fuselage of an aircraft truss three dimensional stress space structure dummy or unit load method we have considered we have also learned different energy metho ds to find out deflection refer slide t ime zero two hundred and twenty-nine and then we move forward we have already learned the definition of stress how does it come and here we will be considering the equilibrium equation in this lecture refer slide t ime zero two hundred and forty so as we have already mentioned that we will be learning equations of equilibrium or in a different word if we say that how the equilibrium is maintained while a structure is loaded that we will see and as in the last lecture we have mentioned that the uniform st ress condition is a very rare case it is difficult to find out but in the other case which is most common that case in a generalized manner is shown in this particular slide the particular slide consists a huge thing on the figure the figure what is sho wn here this figure consists many thing so we will describe we will try to learn those things and let us see what are the things how those things we need and how can we find out the equilibrium equation let us consider a cuboid element with dimensions dx dy and dz so this is dx along the x please note that this length is d x this is d x this is dx this is d x dy and d z similarly dy is this length as it is mentioned once here dy dy dy or this is dy or dz dz is this length this length this length or thi s length now directly we are saying taking moment about the axis but before we take a moment about the axis it is better to note that here what are the things shown in this cuboid this cuboid is not similar to the last cuboid what we have seen in the la st cuboid in both the x planes what was on the origin the plane on the origin this is the origin this is plane passing through the origin and this is a plane which is dx apart one more x plane in the previous case we assume that since the stress conside red was uniform in both the cases stresses were same but in this particular case these are not same as i have mentioned or we have observed that its get it the stresses changes its value how we do not know how does it change but we can have a function whi ch is a variable of xy z following that the sigma x or the all the nine components of stresses changes its value so say in that all the stress components in the for the first example say sigma xx is a function of is a function of xy z if it is a function o f xy z for the increment along the length delta x we can find a gradient and this gradient if we multiply by the length dx this is the change for the length plane from this plane the plane this plane to this plane for sigma x similarly for the that is wh at is shown here this component is shown here sigma x plus this component similarly tau xy if we consider tau xy on the plane x acting on the y direction change in the x direction that is why we are considering derivative with respect to delta x partial derivative with respect to x and for the length delta x this is the total value of change of tau xy that is added to tau xy that gives us the value in this plane similarly if we see this is delta tau xz del x del tau xz del x is the gradient and multipli ed by delta x so similar way if we see this plane and this plane will always have some incremental value according to the position of the plane that is the reason here all the three components are considered as partial derivative with respect to x multi plied by delta x here partial derivative with respect to y multiplied by delta y same in this case partial derivative with delta z in multiplied by dz so all these three components we can see now we have imbalance right which is a common case most ge neral case now let us try to see whether all these nine components what we have given by sigma ij are different or they have some relation in between so to consider that the first property what we will be trying to prove is the complementary stress equality to do that what we need to do as it is mentioned here that we are taking a moment through the center of the element parallel to z axis so what is that parallel to z axis we are considering one axis like this and we are considering moment of all the for ces this is the axis better we increase that makes better visual representation about this axis we are considering moment what are the moment components will come we have already discussed a moment in three dimension in one example while we are solving tr uss problems say let us start with the x plane in this x plane this will not have any component because it is passing through this this will not have any component whereas this is along the axis that is why you do not have any component whereas this wi ll have some component because the perpendicular distance from this to this and it is acting in the transverse direction to that axis so if that is having a component similarly in the other plane this also will have a component that is what is written he re tau xy multiplied by this area this area is delta y and delta z this is delta y this is delta z this is the area so it becomes force what is the momentum that is delta x by two this is delta x by two so that is the momentum so once we understand any one component of this equation we can understand all the components very easily that is the reason we are trying to do so this is a small mistake this distance is not this one actually the distance is this distance this is also delta x by two so for this co mponent this delta x by two is acting this component so that component is written here tau xy plus incremental value area makes it force and this is the momentum what else what other components will come this is about x plane fine what will come from this z plane nothing will come because this component this component or this component or are acting in that same line so there will be no component coming from the z plane similarly this will not have any component but we will have a component from the y plane this will have a component this will not have any component because it is along the line of that axis what we are talking about there is no difference this is also will not have any component because it is along this line whereas this will have a component this one so tau yx similarly this will have a component tau yz i think this is a mistake this should be yx this should be yz so in in the other figures also probably it is there we please correct it so it is acting in the x direction so it must be yx it is in the y plane so please correct in the future one if i remember i will also correct it is a simple copy paste error please ignore that so tau yx this tau yx multiplied by the area delta x delta z delta x delta z force and component as we have seen this is this component this is will come as delta y by two delta y by two and similarly the minus will come later let us see the components first and similarly this is the other component delta yx delta tau yx del y del y area and this is the m oment r now why it is positive and why it is negative if we look at the components this is acting in the positive direction that means the right following the right hand screw system so it is rotating in following the right hand screw system so consid ering that as positive these components are considered this components are considered as positive and the other one which is acting this way it is following the left hand screw system if you look at so that is the reason this is having negative direction now let us move to the next slide this slide has already become very very dirty let us clean it and move it so please note that this is a small mistake you please ignore that and whatever corrected that value you can consider and proceed refer slide time one thousand, five hundred and forty-three so the next slide this equation is repeated the first equation just to have a reminder as we have pointed out earlier this is a small correction this is yx and this is yz so what happens if we simplify this if we go for simplification we have components these two half half will add up and give this component and we have the differential component separate where we have delta x square by two similarly here also we have that component this is half of makes it one and we have the other compo nent now what we can do divide this equation by del x del y del z or the volume of that cuboid and taking the limit del x del y approaches to zero what we have is that if you do you can easily see that that tau xy is equals to tau yx so this considering th e limit the remaining dx and dy this part will go to zero and will these two will remain these two are getting divided so that is not coming into picture you please solve it and you find that tau xy is equals to tau yx so what is happening three components are reducing from nine we have six component of stresses because we can easily prove the same thing tau xz is equals to tau z x tau yz is equals to tau z y so that makes us that there are six components we see therefore that a shear stress acting on a given plane tau xy tau xz or tau yz is always accompanied by an equal complementary shear stress of tau yx tau z x tau z y acting on a plane perpendicular to the given plane and in the opposite sense so this is important point you should keep it in mind shear stress never comes alone it is always having a complementary part and we need to consider that whenever we are doing any analysis so with this node we move forward for equilibrium condition refer slide t ime one thousand, nine hundred and nine now one more thing we need to establish t hat is the equilibrium condition we need to establish now considering the equilibrium of the element in x direction here a new thing comes in that is the body force now considering the equilibrium of the element in x direction including a body force comp onent x acting in the positive x direction body force is the force which acts on the volume of the system here it is the structure it is gravitation is a very very good example gravitational force is the very good example of body force electromagnetic force or some other forces may be visualized as body force so say if it is a body force is acting so inside the structures with the stress components how the body force keeps the equilibrium that is what we need to establish and we will try to establish in mathematical equations form so to do that we are what we are doing it is same cuboid please consider these two corrections better i do because i remember this is yx this is yz so we are considering the x direction sum of all forces equals to zero here interesting point that we will have how many components six components because in this plane there are six planes and each plane we have one x component force so considering the normal one first that is sigma xx this is also subscript sigma xx plus del sigma x del x dx this acting on the area this area minus this we are considering this way positive this way positive minus this this component similarly this will come xy del xy del y that means this component minus this component this component always the area is considered to make it force stress to force and we have one more here this force tau xz del z this minus this now since we are we have talked about the body force that is acting on the volume that is del x del y del z of intensity x we put it w e make it to zero it is in equilibrium equilibrium has to be mentioned as we have done here and if we simple observation gives us the equation that del sigma is del x plus del tau x tau yx or xy del y plus tau tau del tau zx or xz by del x del z plus x is eq uals to zero so considering the complementary stress property as i was mentioning that we generally say it in this form that partial derivative of normal stress and two shear stress components in y and z plane plus the body force is equals to zero so this is considering on the on the x direction is not it this is considering x direction what about y what about z we will definitely have similar equation refer slide t ime two thousand, three hundred and thirty-six if we consider those directions equilibrium and we can write those without go ing into the same type of discussion that that similar equilibrium equations hold in all the three directions and we have the equations as mentioned here this is in the y direction please note that the normal stresses maintain the direction del sigma is d el x del x this is the other two del tau xy del y delta xz del z similarly this is delta del tau xy del x del sigma y by del y tau yz del z this is y because this is y and similarly this is z this is z and this is not difficult to memorize better you kee p in mind this equation these equations are good equations to remember and it helps in many many way in many situation if you go for further study the equations of equilibrium must be satisfied at all interior points in a deformable body under a three d imensional force system so under three dimensional force system this is what we have one more way it may be written that is most popular to understand and that is generally followed in advanced books but that is the reason unless it is introduced now it will be difficult for you to follow those that so the tensorial notation or index notation as we have already introduced to we need to do this f i is a subscript please note it down this is subscript so what we write that sigma ij j plus f i is equals to zero for i equals to one to three or xyz and j equals to one to three or xyz or as we have seen in the previous lecture i j equals to one two three so there is a comma here what does that mean in index notation there is a repetition of j here what does that mean in index notation how this notation expresses these three equations at a time this notation at a time expresses all these three equations that we need to note so if anyone says this actually he is talking about these three equations how in this process if an index operator appears sorry index appears twice in it means summation and a comma j is twice here that that will yield these plus signs this is and the comma means derivative with respect to that index comma j means this sigma ij is per taken a partial d erivative with respect to j so this since it it is a comma j it is partial derivative that is the reason here it is say the first term if we talk about i equals to one j equals to one that gives me that del sigma eleven since comma is there del x plus is there so that is the reason we have del then j will change keeping one constant j is changing what will happen del sigma twelve divided by del y better to say i think i say it in xy that will make it easier to understand del sigma xx this is x this is xyz like that del sigma del x plus del sigma xy del y second value of this plus del third one sigma xz divided by del z this plus x one this the first subscript remains same is that i s the reason x here it is f i this is ff i or if one is equals to zero so if i expand this s imilarly if we consider two next time and then again this this this if we consider we get the second equation and similarly we can have the third equation also so that is the reason that is the reason it is stated in this here in a different form this is the way it is generally expressed sigma eleven with derivative one this is nothing but this this is this this is this and this is this so with this notation we move forward to the next slide refer slide t ime three thousand and two in this scenario it is a good opportu nity to introduce the plane stress it is a special case where of three dimensional stress analysis most aircraft structures structural components are fabricated from thin metal sheets so that stresses across the thickness of the sheet are usually negligib le assuming say that the z axis is in the direction of the thickness what we can assume that sigma z equals to zero tau x z equals zero tau yz equals to zero so if we sigma zz if we put all the z direction stresses equals to zero this column vanishes as well as since this and this are the same this also vanishes so the remaining thing is that these two and this this two and this so the stress consideration becomes tau i think this may be the first equation this is second or maybe the other way del sigma xx del x plus d elta tau xy del y plus x is equals to zero and the second equation is this one so again generally convention is to write this as the first equation this as the second equation but while copy pasting it has reversed sorry please note that so with that the particular condition what we prevail in plane stress condition is that the z direction stress components are zero and that induces the equilibrium equation in a simplified form refer slide t ime three thousand, two hundred and three so the boundary condition continues we will be cons idering the bound we have considered equations with respect to the body forces inside the structures but we need to consider the equilibrium also if there are some surface forces acting so with respect to the surface forces what are the things equations we get and how do they look like let us see it is not very difficult since the most difficult understanding in cuboid all those stress distributions you have already come across so with that we proceed further equations of equilibrium derived last satisfy equilibrium sorry requirement of equilibrium at all points in the body or inside the body equilibrium must include equilibrium must be including the boundary of the body where surface forces are x bar y bar and z bar so it has also to be mentioned or maintained in the surface and per unit area where the surface forces are x bar y bar and z bar if we have a triangular element at the boundary of a 2d body then it is it looks like this this particular portion will be covering from two dimensional to three d imension i some books it is it is started from a tetrahedral from three dimensional consideration but there are some lacuna i do not want to mention those but it is easy to understand and follow from the two dimension so what we are considering let us p roceed we are considering this element and that element in this is in a body with a normal end and that element is simplified way shown here and what we see in this element is uh that ab is the boundary ac cb the internal surface this is inside the body this this this and this and at ab the surface forces are x bar and y bar x bar and y bar at ac and cb internal stresses are acting that is since it is in x direction sigma xx tau xy is acting this way and in the y plane we have sigma yy and tau yx actin g this way x is given body force here it is not shown x multiplied by the volume is the body force this multiplied by the surface area this is the surface force so there are two types of forces we need to consider those we need to have an equilibrium so what we are trying to do we are considering similar way the summation of x equals to zero so if we consider summation of x equals to zero this as i said this is surface force delta s we are considering unit width on the transverse direction on the on the de pth side of the element so ds remains makes the area so x bar multiplied by ds this is acting this way sigma x dy is acting this way this one is acting here tau yx dx is acting in this direction and then the other body force coming here that is capital x multiplied by half of delta x delta y is the volume unit width is considered that is the reason we say in that tetrahedron derivation this part is not shown it is said it may be done so what will happen let us see refer slide t ime three thousand, six hundred and twelve the same equation is repeated in this slide by taking the limit as delta x approaches zero we can have that x bar this terms vanishes so that gives us that x bar is equals to actually this is becoming delta y by delta s then we are considering limit so we are consid ering a derivative or we can say that that becomes the direction cosine so that direction cosine component comes this term vanishes because delta x tends to zero approaches zero and we have the body forces as x bar equals to sigma x xl tau yx m so this is for two dimension definitely in the y direction we can have from the y equals to zero the same way that y bar is equals to tau xy l plus sigma y by m is equals to y bar similarly for a three dimensional case we can have with the surface forces the equations sigma x sigma xy sigma xz l m n and here also similar to that there it was a derivative here it is only direction cosines are coming there is no derivative is considered and we have the equilibrium of surface forces and in tonsorial real notation as we h ave described i would ask you to do this homework for the tonsorial notation it is better to learn the tonsorial notation or index notation j is repeated please note that is the reason plus sign has come two two three three one remains same j is changing so t one t two t three this again will come in a very different way in many times this equation will come we will use this equation many times so better you memorize this equation this or this or this anyway is the most simple way to remember that whole equation we generally remember that refer slide t ime three thousand, eight hundred and thirty-eight so with that note we move forward and it is similar the book references are same elasticity books and other books are used here refer slide t ime three thousand, eight hundred and forty-seven we have learned equilibrium from theory of elasticity po int of view and thank you for attending this lecture"}
{"audio_filepath": "/media/rishu/Data1/Code Playground/test_ai4b/wav/25.wav", "duration": 2843.58, "text": "enty-five stress transformation and principal stress so welcome back to aircraft structures one course this is professor anup ghosh from aerospace engineering department iit kharagpur we are in the 5th week lectures this is in sequence 25th lecture today we will learn about principal stress in two dimension in three dimension some are easily introduced some are introduced with mathematical concept with tensor calculus so whatever you understand it is good otherwise i would suggest you to refer some advanced books as it is listed there or maybe some advanced books on tensor calculus refer slide t ime zero one hundred and twenty-three so with that we will step forward for the recapitulation slide that is as usual history of aircraft and aerospace structural analysis or solid mechanics then external loads structural details load factors all those things we have seen how it affects how do external load s come those are experienced by different structural parts then shear and movement effects on fuselage and wing how 3d truss is used in aircraft structures one big example is landing gear other examples are may be tailboom of helicopter or there are man y others these are two visible distinct places where we see so like that we have also covered different energy methods to find out deflection how deflection is important in probably last or last to last lecture i have tried to tell you in detail introdu ction of theory of elasticity already you ha you are introduced with theory of elasticity stress and equilibrium equations we have done in our last lectures refer slide t ime zero two hundred and fifty-nine and today we will be covering some topics which encompasses the stress transformation will solve a small problem we will try to derive the principal stresses we will try to have the idea of principal stresses so that idea is important and that plays a big role why stress is important principle stress is important principa l stress is important in the sense that is the highest amplitude of stress acting inside the structure because of different loading condition and that may directly govern to failures like say if it is a tensile failure or a compressive crushing failure those are the stresses which is since those are maximum in amount in magnitude those leads to that type of failure so for a combined stressed body where three dimensional stress is acting in practical actually all the structures whatever we see are expe riencing almost all the components of a stresses like starting from sigma one sigma eleven sigma twenty-two sigma thirty-three to normal stresses to shear stresses like sigma twelve sigma twenty-three or sigma twelve twenty-three and thirty-one so all stresses may act so in combination of all stresses which one a nd which direction it becomes maximum that is important to study we need to find out depending on that structure is designed so that is the reason it is very very important those are having some important properties and we will observe those properties refer slide t ime zero five hundred and four so let us move to the first topic first topic is a stress transformation i stress transformation what we do is a simple way how a stress is transformed this is probably covered in your mechanics in some courses and if it is no t with some skip some detail we will try to cover now so what we are we have in our first figure we often need a to find stresses at some other plane of a body so this stress transformation is brought fast to be before the principle stresses because the principal stress is obtained from the stress transformation unless we have the concept of stress transformation it is difficult to imagine where the principal stress is acting so in this particular case again my aim will be to discuss more on concepts like how does it act where it acts what are the phenomena those things i will also try to cover mathematics whatever is written on slide and the way it is done but some of the stuffs as i say are probably will not come into your understanding as and whe n it is said you need to put some time to understand those you need to put consult some other books to understand those i would suggest if you are planning for higher studies you should go through those and try to understand again we are going away from today\u2019s topic so let us start today\u2019s topic what is the stress transformation the need is that to find stress at some other plane we can imagine some element in books in many times this element is shown as a rectangle sorry a square but it is not nec essarily to be square so it is considered as a rectangle here and that rectangle because of the external loads is experiencing possible all stresses we are not considering the third dimension third dimension which is towards the board or away from the board it is considered that it is a two dimensional case where a plane is under these stresses possible stress components are as we see the normal stress is shown as sigma xx sigma yy this is balancing one and we also have tau xy last class we have estab lished that there is also always a complementary shear stress so these are the complementary components so once we have these two pair they are also must have these two pair these two this pair should come along with this pair so now the question as we have started that we need to find out stress say on this inclined plane inside like this element that inclined plane is denoted by ab and we are separating out that here once we separate it out there we do not know the stress condition at this plane that is the reason we have put that sigma n is acting normal to that plane and there is one more component that is tau nt or along the plane so this idea already we have that even if there are other components in two dimensional cases all those components m ay sum up to these two components one which are orthogonal to each other ninety degree to each other sigma n and tau nt sometimes nt is drop it is directly said as tau so other components as it is shown here those are brought here only thing is that it is given a finite dimension a small dimension that is a very small delta x in this direction delta y in this direction and it is delta s in this direction so if we try to consider the equilibrium x direction that is what if this is the force amount this is acting in this direction tau xy del del x is acting in this direction this is considered the other direction sigma n ok theta is not shown so this is theta while this is theta so if this is theta then we have that delta n cos theta is the component and delta s is the area considering unit width of the element and the other tau is having sin theta component so we get this equation in this direction similarly in the vertical direction if we consider we have sigma yy dx the area we have tau xy this tau xy acting on delta y and sigma n sine component it is acting upward whereas this is acting downward its on the other side of the equal sign so it is having minus sign and it is in this form so it is acting in vertical direction now if we solve these two equation we can easily get this equation and this equation solving i have skipped intentionally so it you can easily do because it is already covered otherwise i can give you a simple idea to do it if we multiply this equation with cos and this equation with sine this with cos this with sine and add it up this portion will cancel and we will get the expression of sigma n and this delta y by delta s which is nothing but the cos so other cos will come from here no we are multiplying with the cos that make s the cos square theta so similar way we can find we can find out that sigma n equals to sigma x cos square theta plus sigma y sin square theta plus tau x y sin two theta and the way i have said if you follow the same way and some simple subtraction of t he two equations will lead to the expression of tau or shear on a plane which is at theta angle with vertical refer slide t ime one thousand, three hundred and thirty so with that small concept we are trying to solve a problem in this the problem is shown on the figure it is also de scribed in the writing so let us read the writing first a cylindrical beam this is the cylindrical beam of circular cross section circular cross section supports a compressive load fifty newton this is the compressive load fifty newton fifty kilo newton applie d to its free end this section is the free end at a point fifteen mm fifteen mm below a horizontal diameter in the horizontal plane of symmetry this is the horizontal diameter and the horizontal plane of symmetry below that that is the reason from that point it is fifteen mm below together with a torque of one thousand, two hundred newton meter the torque is one thousand, two hundred newton meter calculate the direct and shear stresses on a plane inclined at sixty degree to the axis of the cantilever is this one at a point on the lower edge of the vertical pla ne of the symmetry so it is asked that at this point what is the shear stress on a plane inclined sixty degree to the axis so we need to find out that so to find out that it is a combined bending and axial and torsion problem there are two loads external l oads actually one is this axial load other is torsion but since it is not acting on the axis of symmetry it will produce some moment so that moment we need to find out and there is a torsion and because of that the element here is stressed and what are th e stresses and stress components that we need to find out so the direct loading system is equivalent to an axial load of fifty kilo newton together with bending moment off that is what the bending moment comes here fifty that is the kilo fifteen newton millimeters that means seventy-five thousand newton millimeter newton per millimeter i think it is a mistake it is not oblique it is newton millimeter this is newton millimeter so with that note therefore at any point on the lower edge of the vertical plane of symmetry there are c ompressive stress due to the axial load that fifty kilo newton and bending moment which act on planes perpendicular to the axis of the beam and are evaluated below so the sigma x direct p by a axial load only that is fifty kilo newton divided by the area we ge t one hundred and seventy-seven newton millimeter square and the other way bending stress m is the bending moment here y is the how far it is from the axis of symmetry this is thirty that is thirty is there is the y i is the section moment of inertia of that circular section its put here and we get that thirty-nine sorry thirty-five newton per millimeter square both are acting actually as a compressive load because we are talking about the lower point so with that condition we also have a shear stress the shear stress tau xy at the same point due to the torque is this is the amount of torque and then the similar way we put the torsion formula and we get this is the value of polar moment of inertia of that particular section thirty is the radius and we get that two hundred and eighty-three so we have normal stresses as well as shear stress refer slide t ime one thousand, eight hundred and fifty-eight now we observe that the stress system acting on a two dimensional rectangular element at the point is shown in the figure it is same figure we are considering we do not have any problem only it is said that this an gle is sixty degree the instead of specifying this angle in the problem this angle is specified note that since the element is positions at the bottom of the beam the shear stress due to the torque is in the opposite direction of the shown positive directio n so the torque tau is acting in this direction tau is internal so it is acting in this direction again sigma n and tau may be found from first principle or by direct substitution in the previously derived equations so theta is thirty degree that is what i j ust now mention here the in the according to the problem it is mentioned that this is sixty degree figure is not conforming to that please consider that this is sixty degree that is the reason we have saying that theta is equals to thirty degree the total compress ive stress we get as minus of two hundred and twelve newton here we have need a oblique per millimeter square compressive sigma y is zero there is no force in the y direction tau xy is minus two hundred and eighty-three newton per millimeter square the negative sign is arising from the fact that it is opposite direction to tau x y as shown in the figure now what we we do we simply substitute the values in the equations and we get that sigma n is equals to four hundred and four newton per millimeter square so it is minus that is the reason it is not in this direct ion it is in this direction and it is compressive in nature and whatever tau we are getting is that five newton per millimeter square acting in the direction ab from this to this this direction is ok different answer would have been obtained if the plane ab had been chosen on the opposite side of ec if we chose choose a plane something like this or something like this then we will have a different answer so that is what is said the direction may change because it is on the other side plane which is ninety deg ree apart but anyway we have considered this way and the problem is solved so let us go forward with our next topic refer slide t ime two thousand, two hundred and seven in this topic whatever what we have are introduced that stress transformation that stress transformation we have written in tensorial notation we are considering that the prime axis which is given by alpha beta is the transferred axis system or the plane system on which we want the stress to be found out and the known system where the sigma ij is the stress con dition and we have the direction cosines known as l alpha i and l beta i and since we are talking about two dimension that is the reason twelve is considered here but it is also applicable for three dimension one the same equation we will use this in differe nt way written to derive the principal stress we will see that time so to understand this in a better way we have used some diagram theta ninety degree minus theta all these things are given alpha i and beta j are the direction cosines as it is given and as an example alpha eleven is cos theta alpha twelve is ninety degree minus theta equals to sin theta alpha twenty-two is cos theta and alpha twenty-one is minus sin theta now if we consider as an example the eleven as the normal stress so i j is equals to eleven sorry alpha beta is equals to eleven so this is one i this is bit one j so if that is the case only i j to vary that is what eleven twenty-two twelve twenty-one the variation of i j is considered and similar way whatever values are coming as eleven since these are both are one it is eleven eleven here it is this is two to bot h two that is the reason these two are two here twelve that is the reason eleven twelve here twenty-one twenty-one is there so accordingly if we substitute the values from here we get the equation whatever we have got for sigma n so this is one good understanding and that this small tensorial expression can give us the coordinate transformation very easily and stress transformation to a different coordinate or to a different plane with respect to plane it is easy to understand but actually we are imagining a different coordinate syst em which is inclined in that manner in three dimensional in two dimension it is very easy to imagine in three dimension i would request you or suggest you to to form some access system like my three fingers and then you can have rotate this axis system i do not have two right hands that is the problem so you can make one more right angle system and put along with this and with respect to this center or maybe having a translation you can easily imagine the how it changes the access system from one to th e other so keep it in mind we are considering both as right hand cartesian coordinate system and unless you prepare one template following that it is difficult to show you so i would suggest you may do it and experience it refer slide t ime two thousand, six hundred and fourteen so this is a small topic introduced in between just as a reminder we need this always in different condition we will repeat it again it is something very interesting it is a t this surface normal is given by this i think i need to go backward yes this sur face normal is given by n one i into j and n two k and the traction force is given by this t one t two and t three n is because it is on the n plane the plane which is denoted by n and the internal stress system we can have that is equals to sigma n and tau nt which is acting and the amplitude we can easily find out simple from the vectors rule already we have considered and if we expand this which is the equilibrium equation nothing else this is the normal and tangential component of this the stack traction force and this is the internal force sigma ij which is in balance this is the equilibrium equation we have found out so if i know all these components we can easily find out these components and if we can find out these components if one of these are known we can find out the other is once we know the coordinate system nj is the components of unit vector that is cos unit normal this is n with respect to the j and this is similarly sigma j and sigma tau may be found out that means here it is talking about this ok so um we move forward to the next slide refer slide t ime two thousand, eight hundred and thirty-seven principle stress principle stress is really important point to discuss we will introduce it with respect to two dimension first and we will go forward with advanced mathematical de rivation for three dimension we will find out and again we will discuss principle stress in the next cl ass lecture and we will see so in this condition what we do is that we have sigma n considering a plane which is at an angle theta and if we want to find out the axis system or the plane along which this is maximum value we need to find the partial derivative of with respect to theta that is what is done here if we do that derivative if you please note that that leads to this equation we will come to that later 2i cos theta sin theta sigma x minus will come because cos is there this is twice sin theta cos theta and this is tau xy cos two theta two will come definitely in all the cases two are there so if we make that thing is equals to zero we get an a ngle tan two theta is equals to two twice tau xy by sigma x minus sigma y i would suggest you carry out this that simple mathematics is not the topic of discussion here here the topic of discussion is that see we with that value substituting that we can have two values of sigma that is sigma one and sigma two this derivation is available in all books i would suggest you refer that we can have the two values two roots of sigma n which with replacement of theta as sigma one and sigma two this is the convention it is given sometimes sigma numeric one numeric two not that roman one roman two which is sigma x plus sigma y by two plus minus half root over sigma x minus sigma y square plus four tau x y square now question is that this is these are the two normal stresses where we have tau equals to zero that is the reason i said if you derive this we get this equation and this if we put this equation is zero that is nothing but the tau is equals to zero so we have that plane where tau is equals to zero so in the other sense in a in it is a very common practice to say that principle stress is the stress or the maximum stress at a plane where tau or the shear stress is equals to zero and those are the maximum values with possible combination of orientation of axis system different way orien tation of plane where we are trying to find out normal stress where sigma one is the maximum or major principle stress and sigma two is the minimum or minor principle stress so this major and minor terms are used popularly note that sigma one is algebraically the greatest direct stress at the at that point since it is having a plus sign while sigma two is algebraically the least therefore when sigma two is found out considering negative sign it is possible that sigma two to be numerically greater than one while it is sigma one while its value is negative so this is a good point to note that the compressive stress may become larger in numeric value in some condition so it is not that since it is having a plus the material the maximum stress is experienced by while we are considering plus value only plus value is only showing that the material is in tension but while it is negative sign it shows that the material is in compression so in this point for the maximum shear stress if we talk about the tau we have in si milar way we can have that it is the angle tan two theta again we can find out but it is inverse and minus sign is there with respect to this so please note that this is a different angle so we have a different angle in this context it is better to remembe r the mohr cycle sorry mohr circle of stresses where we put in tau and sigma axis refer slide t ime three thousand, four hundred and fifty-three the values of at different orientation of plane what are the normal and shear stresses are and if you look at those values that in general case i f it is the mohr circle this is sigma this is tau we will find that this is the sigma one and sigma two or may be the other way i think better to show it in the other way otherwise confusion will create this is two this is one you please note that in this condi tion at these two points tau is always zero but while tau is having maximum value sigma is not equals to zero so that does not mean that the normal stress is not there is no normal stress on that particular orientation so keeping in mind that thing we would like to discuss one interesting problem so before we go to that interesting problem which i will discuss partially and i would like to ask you to explore on yourself tan two theta we have now put for the maximum value these values if we put in the equati ons previously said in the last one we get that the tau max value is nothing but sigma one minus sigma two by two above equation give the maximum shear stress at the point in the body in the plane of the given stress given stresses for a three dimensional bod y supporting a two dimensional stress system this is not necessarily the maximum shear stress at that point so that is the reason we are repeatedly saying it is a two dimensional case we are discussing since maximum principle stress plane angle is the neg ative reciprocal of the maximum shear stress angle then the angle two theta given by these two equations differ by ninety degree so or the planes of maximum shear stress are inclined at forty-five degree to the principal stress in this case i would like to give you a good problem that is what i thought if we consider one element and if it is under this stress condition there is no shear stress acting and if we imagine one element inside which is having forty-five degree angle i would like to suggest you to find out what is the stress condition stress status in this element and this is very interesting problem with correlation to a problem while we twist a chalk and it fails it fails in a very particular orientation that may be discussed in some other way in some other oppo rtunity but this is very interesting problem you can solve it and observe it so let us move forward with our next topic refer slide t ime three thousand, nine hundred and fourteen next topic is really is an advanced topic i would will try to try to cover as much as i can it is as much as i can it is derivation general derivation of a principal stress we have derived in two dimension but in three dimension it is difficult to derive so with respect to the tensor calculus and lagrange multiplier concept we will try to derive given sig ma xx at a point we seek a direction n equals to n p as it given such that normal stress is the extremum value that is the problem in mathematics point of view if we talk about we want to extremely find out the extremum or the extreme value or the maximu m minimum value of the normal stresses in a orientation which gives the maximum so if we consider that sigma m n is a general expression of stress and if we consider only the normal stress of that component that becomes in boils down to slowly from m n r educes to only n and then it is once direction and we get that sigma ij and direction cosines if we multiply it becomes this way so the normal stress at any plane which is l and l ni l nj direction cosine is having n p say is denoted by distinction now this is the usual way of telling that this property to satisfy and this property to satisfy is direction cosine property is to satisfy and that same thing is said again into different way and this is also l square m square this is nothing but this these are also same thing so it is stated in a different way to give you understanding for the thing which we are going to do now we are bringing one concept of lagrange multiplier we will extremize the equation a the normal stress to be extreme extremized with respect to i j but what is the constraint with respect to n j as i said with a restraining condition equation b that means it should maintain the we are transferring the coordinate system but that coordinate system should follow the cartesian called coordinate system rule that is the cartesian coordinate system rule this is the cartesian coordinate system rule that is the reason is saying that restraining condition equation b it has to follow that we proceed to extremize the following function with the introduction of lagrange multiplier we are going to extremize this function where the normal stress is given by this we are considering that the sigma is some value the normal value of it and it is following the same rule of cartesian coordinate syste m as it is given here that is substituted back with respect to n one n two here and we are supposed to take the derivative of it ok refer slide t ime four thousand, three hundred and five derivative of it with respect to what with respect to the direction right the normal stress we need to find out the extreme value with respect to the direction we need to take the derivative and that derivative is considered here so partial derivative of if n i is considered here it is written the same thing once again only this sign is partial der ivative sign is put here now on the left hand side is something what is done with skip of this steps this derivation we are considering with respect to some arbitrary direction s first and if we go on the derivation of s first in this way in between we get this similar to this one equation so this is this equation we get n s n j n s is there the first term this it will lead to those two terms these are the two terms we are getting and then here sigma one this is constant we wo uld not get get that this i s actually a square term there is the reason two sigma ni del ni del n s we are getting now this will lead this derivative will lead to the kronecker delta this chronic delta i think i have not discussed earlier kronecker delta is better to discuss now i should have discussed earlier so if you find earlier you please refer to that kronecker delta is the delta while both the subscripts are having same value it is equals to one otherwise it is equals to zero so if i say delta i j equals to one while i is equal s to j is equals to zero while i is not equals to j that is what the kronecker delta is so this derivative actually leads to this kronecker delta and similarly other chronic delta also we find now with this what we have this leads to this this leads to this i think you can easily say that if we if we put this property we get this value this remains in this sense and a good observation and a little knowledge of tensor calculus if you put you will find that this is equals this step as i said is the in betwee n step this one and if we follow this step this actually leads to this value i s is substituted here with the j i j and this value we get and this is actually the condition of principal stress this sigma is the principal stress value which represents in three homogeneous simultaneous equations if we expand ij to this value and we can find the values of sigma for a nontrivial solution of this part with this concept i would like to conclude the principal stress will come back again with principle stress c oncept we will discuss and will go further with different values of principle stress as i mentioned important things on the plane where principal stress acts the shear stress is equals to zero principle stresses we need to find out in design cases because that may govern to failure of the system it may be compression it may be tension and the maximum shear stress also we need to find because sometimes the failure leads from shear stresses refer slide t ime four thousand, seven hundred and twenty-five so with this note we move forward wit h the standard books whatever i have covered it is available in these books only refer slide t ime four thousand, seven hundred and thirty-seven and we conclude the todays lecture thank you for attending and we will move forward for our next lecture thank you"}

aircraft structures one course this is professor anup ghosh from aerospace engineering department iit kharagpur we are in the 5th week lectures to the introduction of stresses we have covered different conditions of stresses we have covered stress transformation and in that sense we have in co vered the concept of principal stress why we need to find out where and how does it act it is on the changing plane in the direction we need to consider and we have also considered the boundary conditions and we will go forward further with some example on boundary condition and a little bit more note on the principal stresses refer slide t ime zero one hundred and twenty so as usual the recapitulation slide if we look at already we have covered history of aircraft and aerospace structures as well as solid mechanics various types of external loads and conceptual structural details we have covered flight envelope and load factors we have covered how a shear and moment on wing and fuselage of an aircraft truss aircraft structure comes that we have done truss and space t russes also we have done we have covered different unit load methods castiglianos theorem and rayleigh ritz method under energy methods we have found deflections different ways of finding deflections of structure refer slide t ime zero two hundred and eighteen and we wil l go forward in the theory of elasticity classes we are concerning only about strain and we will see how some example and we will talk more about principle stresses refer slide t ime zero two hundred and thirty so the example we have is that it is a an element of length ab so let us start with the equilibrium equation find the stress at boundary y equals to b at this boundary let us start with the equilibrium equation where tractions are acting on an inclined plane t we need to find out t is given by this q zero we are supp osed to it is given this we are supposed to find out this is also given from the element orientation so here left hand side is the applied load on the body sigma ij is the stress tensor at the point n j is the outward normal\u2019s at boundary points what are the normal\u2019s here so for the present case along y equals to b here it is angle with alpha q zero alpha the two components will be there i and j x and y direction definitely the third direction is zero there is no such component q zero cos alpha i q zero sin alpha z are the two components and accordingly t one t two we will get t one is q zero cos alpha t two is q zero sin alpha so keeping in mind this as we have seen in previous classes we can easily go further and find out the components refer slide t ime zero two hundred and thirty so what we have is that t i is equals to sigma i j n j n values beta two this this is the expanded form in the previous slide we have found out t one t two value n we know we know means we need to denote it that it is in one is equals to zero because we are talking abo ut this one n two is in this direction equals to one and n three is equals to zero if it is inclined some plane then it probably will have n one and n two value so here it is not having that n one value and n three is always zero because we are considering two dimensional probl em with help of three dimensional equilibrium equation so now what we are putting we are simply putting those values t one is equals to this sigma one two or sigma this this equation we are using this is zero this is zero sigma one two is equals to t one is equals to k zero cos alpha and since complementary shear stresses are same that is why one two two one is made to zero made to equal and from the second expanded equilibrium equation what we have is that sigma two two is equals to q zero sin alpha and from the third one what we have is that there is no two three or three two shear component because it is a two dimensional stress condition definitely there wo uld not be any shear component acting from perpendicular to the board so definitely those are zero so this is a nice small example this example explains this equilibrium equation use of this equilibrium equation very well it is aim is to give you that idea why and how we can use this equation so with that concept you can apply this equation for further use refer slide t ime zero six hundred and seventeen so we come back to the principal stress principle stress has been derived in two dimension it has been derived in three dimension also and the equation what we got at the end of the last class is similar to this and we said that we for the non violation vanishing s olution of n one n two and n three the determinant of this the previous class if you have seen previous lecture that portion should be zero sigma ij minus sigma delta ij must be equals to zero and if we make that thing equals to zero and write it in expanded form this m atrix calculus i would suggest you please carry out in some books it is available in what in most of the books it is kept but i would suggest you once do if you have some time you will find these constants and with respect to these constants we can easily express that equation this equation as minus sigma three cube a one sigma square sigma cube a one sigma square a two sigma a three is equals to zero so that this has to obtain while a one is equals to sigma eleven sigma twenty-two sigma thirty-three general stresses coming from thi s sigma i j a two also components of sigma i j as we have seen in this form but this multiplied by this minus this multiplied by this plus plus plus plus this is a jacobean type of jacobean matrix anyway we need to call consider that and it is the a three is th e determinant value of that particular matrix sigma ij if sigma one sigma two and sigma two are the roots of the equations then definitely this will have this equations follow this equations and this sigma one sigma two sigma three are the principal stresses and we ca n easily prove there are proofs available we are not going to prove here that this a one what is expressed here that also follows that if sigma one sigma two sigma three are the roots or the principal stresses in three orthogonal planes it also follows that a one is equals to sigma one sigma two sigma three a two is equals to sigma one sigma two sigma two sigma three and sigma three sigma one and a three is equals to sigma one sigma two sigma three for symmetric stress these are known as the stress invariance that means for a this concept is a k ind of something whatever may be the stress condition of a three dimensional stressed element represented by sigma ij better we write sigma ij we can find out a orientation of the axis system or we can say we can find out three planes which are mutually orthogonal to each other those are having zero cr stresses and acted upon by the three principal stresses sigma one sigma two and sigma three so again if i look that if sigma ij is with respect to this coordinate system we can find some coordinate system some orien tation may be this way this way or the other way in those coordinate system we can have three perpendicular or orthogonal planes on those three orthogonal planes there are three normal stresses acting those normal stresses are the principal stresses and on those planes there are no shear stresses and from mathematics point of view we can prove that those stresses principle stresses always obeys this rule that means this is equals to this the relation between the first coordinate system to the principal c oordinate system is this is equals to this this is equals to this and this is equals to this this is known as the three stress invariance i hope to some extent i have made it clear some symmetric stress tensors for some symmetric stress tensors the th ree principle stresses are all real and the three principle planes are mutually orthogonal just now i have said that it has to be mutually orthogonal following the cartesian coordinate system if you see that is ensured in the derivation in the with help of the lagrange multiplier if the reference axis x one x two and x three are chosen to coincide with the principal axis this is interesting i said this is the first coordinate system x for sigma ij now if this sigma first coordinate system this ij coordinate syst em is coinciding with the principal coordinate system then it is said that there is no shear stress that is why these components are zero that is what is chosen the coincides with the principal axis then sigma ij is equals to this so as it is said that if t he principal axis is the coordinate system of x one x two x three though in that those planes there is no shear stresses so with that idea of principle stress in three dimensional state refer slide t ime one thousand, three hundred and twenty-five we would like to move forward this is some int eresting observation like the previous one what we have seen this is a some property it holds that is what we will talk its very interesting property the equilibrium equation condition we have already seen that is the equilibrium equation condition let the coordinate axis x one x two x three be chosen as the principal axis of the stress tension and late the principal stresses are sigma one sigma two sigma three then sigma ij is equals to zero while i is not equals to z then easily this components are t one is equals to sig ma eleven n one t two is equals to sigma two n two t three equals to sigma three n three this comes very easily this has to follow unit vector here the components of the trajectory using this and this we can easily come to this equation which says that t one by sigma one square t two by sigma two square t three by sigma three square is equals to one this is nothing but an equation of ellipsoid or three dimensional ellipsoid now what is this we have a relation what does that mean it means that if we consider a coordinate system coinciding with the principal axis then for any body which is have showing that system or the stress system follows or represents an ellipsoid by the tip of the vector t i this is i will try to again say better before i will try to let me read this is an equation of el lipsoid with reference to a system of rectangular cartesian coordinates with access level with the three traction forces the ellipsoid is the locus of the endpoints of the vector this issuing the common center this is this is probably the best way it is expressed so it is if both are having the common center the traction and the principal axis then the traction vector tip is if it is plotted we will find different points on this and if we join those points it gives me an ellipsoid that is represented b y this equation this is a interesting mathematical phenomena and it follows that rule we sometimes use it for design purpose this becomes some design criteria to check and with that consideration we would like to come to the end of todays lecture refer slide t ime one thousand, seven hundred and four refer slide t ime one thousand, seven hundred and seven where we have discussed about principal stresses and lame\u2019s\u2019 stress ellipsoid and we will come back with some more things on stresses and thank you for attending this lecture we will come back with few m ore idea of stresses and further on strengths and some examples thank you"}

professor anup ghosh from aerospace engineering department iit kharagpur we are in the 5th week lecture series this is in sequence 27th lecture we will be learning on shear stresses we need to learn in many times shear stress governs the failure theories we w ant to discuss in this scope it is discus sed to some extent in a small way probably in mechanics course in the previous courses or it may be discussed with respect to the subjects whatever is generally considered for specific requirement that way refer slide t ime zero one hundred and twenty-three so with that note we move forward to the recapitulation slide we have done a brief history of aircraft as well as a solid mechanics or structural analysis related to aerospace engineering we have learned various types of external loads and how do they act where do they ac t how those are different in landing condition or also in while it is flying and how the load factor plays a big role and how the flight envelope is also important why we do need to keep a monitoring eye on the flight envelope and after that we have le arned that the whole fuselage and wing bending moment shear force diagram with a typical condition of loading we have learned to find out we have got we are introduced with the unit load analysis and then we have gone to the a specific type of trus s struc ture truss is coming so that is three dimensional trusses which is important in aerospace vehicles so that we have learnt with some example of landing gear systems and then in this week we got introduced to the theory of elasticity theory of elasticity you are introduced already with the course of mechanics you are already introduced with what is stress what is strain different forms of stress and strain transformations equilibrium but we need to learn for advanced studies for development of advanced progr ams or analysis we need to learn what people have already done and how they have approached those problem initially and recent days numerical things are not at all discussed here those are discussed in the respective courses along in advance to these top ics what we are discussing now so in that encompassing the definition of stress equilibrium equations principal stresses already we have covered we have also covered the transformation of stresses and one important thing is introduced to you that is the t russ stress transformation or notation of stress system in terms of tensorial or index notation refer slide t ime zero four hundred and twenty-five with that that sequel will come to the shear stress this lecture will consist of shear stress let us see how do we find out shear stress and how do they represent in specific cases famous cases also will be learning with example refer slide t ime zero four hundred and forty-two so shearing stress what i we see is to consider that we are considering any surface as it is given on the right hand side figur e this figure where what we have is that that plane that surface is denoted by the normal n and this normal n vector is denoted as represented above with direction cosines n one n two and n three unit direction cosines so with this we see that we also hold one more important equation that is the traction or external loads what is acting on that that may be divided in components t one t two t three and the magnitude of the resultant shearing stress on a section having the normal n i is given by this this n is sometim es given as n i also in index notation in one two three that is the reason it is stated that way so if the normal stress acting on that particular plane is sigma n and the shear stress acting on that particular plane is tau and then easily we can say that it is that tau square is equals to t i square plus sigma n square so that in a vectorial way we can amplitude vectorial amp which amplitude we can easily find out and then let the principal axis be chosen as the coordinate axis in this this is we are consider ing a special case this is the general type of case and sigma one sigma two sigma three be the principal stresses so it becomes easy to understand because already we are introduced to sigma one sigma two sigma three so because we are introduced to the coordinate tran sformation or transformation of traces stresses also along with that so anything even if it is sigma ij acting on the system or experienced by the system that can easily be transferred to sigma one sigma two sigma three and accordingly we can if we choose accordi ngly we can write that this is sigma ij as it is mentioned here this is in general but if it is in one two three form we can write that t one is equals to sigma one n one sigma t two equals to sigma two n two and t three is equals to sigma three n three now what we can see is that the square of this is nothing but the square of this because those are orthogonal in direction so that gives us this value now if we come to the previous equation what is written this is already in vector way we can easily say if this is t so we can write t hat this may be the sigma n n and this may be the tau n t so we can easily vector definitely here the vector is not completely represented with the length it is only the direction is represented here so following that what we can say that the sigma n n can have be also found out with multiplication of the unit direction cosines and that component if we take all the ten components will give us the normal direction sigma n n so we get the sigma n n is equals to this now if we substitute back to this equa tion what we have is that ta u square is equals to this minus this this one square and few steps are jumped we have jumped here i would suggest you do yourself and try to find out that tau square is equals to n one square n two square multiplied by sigma one sigma two whole square n two square n three square multiplied by sigma two sigma three whole square n three square n one square multiplied by sigma three sigma one whole square so this is a good expression for the shear stress acting on a surface while the surface force surf ace boundary force are denoted by t and the normal stress on that particular plane is given by sigma n n refer slide t ime one thousand and thirteen so we move forward to discuss the situation discuss the shear stress conditions we will consider typical examples it is no t a very general usual example but it is it is having some significant representation so let us see first example we are considering that n one and n two is equals to one by root two that is it is forty-five degree in angle with the sigma one and sigma two axis whatever we have chosen from the general stack system sigma i j we have found out sigma one sigma two and those corresponding directions and we are considering that the say n three is equals to zero so if it is like that we may imagine a cuboid where the n three is a matching o r the third direction is matching with the sigma three whereas n one and n two the other two directions of the qr plane of the cuboid is at forty-five degree angle with respect to their one and two axis now if we substitute this value in the shear stress equation what we have derived in the previous slide what we get is that the tau in that particular plane is equals to half of sigma one minus sigma two so this we can easily visualize that is why the plane of maximum stresses is given here this is one of the maximum stresses wha t we find in that this particular case so similar to the previous example if we consider this is changed to n one and n three just to visualize it properly otherwise it is a similar case whether the axis system is rotated ninety degree with respect to any one axis hardly matters to the stress system so just for visualization we have changed the axis system n one and n three we have considered one by root two that is forty-five degree and n two is co linear or in the same direction to the sigma two and sometimes it is it is easy to imagine with respect to x y z that is the reason this x y z is also given and considered that one and is corresponding to x three corresponding to z and the two is corresponding to y the plane where t is acting along the sigma n and sigma n t along with sigma n n an d sigma nt so what we have similar way sigma one minus sigma three we are getting for the case where sigma one is greater than these are not cut please consider that it is a typographical error sigma one is greater than sigma two sigma two is greater than sigma three the maximum shear stress we get is sigma two and the sorry tau two and the associated normal stress is sigma n n is given by putting the values in this equation we can find out that sigma n n equals to half of sigma one sigma three so we have in those particular p lanes plane we have i have said this it is difficult to imagine we will come to the next slide and see but what is the stress condition and that particular plane in that particular plane the stress condition is this is the trus s shear stress and this is t he normal stress so we have two planes two orthogonal planes one one and n three such that where this same amplitude of stresses are acting and in n two we are on that plane we are not sure what is acting there refer slide t ime one thousand, four hundred and thirty-one so if we move forward s orry here we see the representation of that particular problem what we have discussed in the previous one here what we see is that one and three that is the reason for the drawing sake and for understanding with the type of coordinate system so far we have foll owed we have followed this as we have said that two is along the same direction whereas one and three those planes are making forty-five degree angle so this plane and this plane i should say that this plane this plane is making forty-five degree angle with sigma one as well as sigma three and additionally if we look at this plane is also making forty-five degree with the sigma three and negative of sigma one so that is what is said these are the planes we are talking about this means that the planes two of them on which the shear stress takes on takes on an extreme value makes angle of forty-five degree or one hundred and thirty-five degree with the sigma one and sigma three so corresponding we have two more that i s the reason two both the angles are mentioned so accordingly we find those cases we have one more typical case where we assume that sigma one is equals to sigma two two and they are greater than sigma three so let us see try to check what happens so tau max becomes t one following the similar way putting the substituting the values as we have done earlier and sigma n n is equals to h alf of sigma two sigma three corresponding orientation of the plane is n one equals to n two and since sigma one sigma two are same and it is undefined it is undefined because those are same and it is mathematically speaking we cannot find out the orientation as it is here we can find out the orient orientation but there we cannot find out the orientation and n three which is equals to plus minus one by root two may have some orientation so it is something we can say that this cuboid only but it is rotating with respect t o this axis so it may have different position because the other two are undefined that is the reason keeping in this axis sigma three oriented in this direction or in this direction it may have any angle on the other side so that is the reason it says undefin ed so in terms of x and y and z it has been said again actually the planes corresponding to n x and n y are indeterminate this means that the plane on which tau one is acting makes an angle forty-five degree or one hundred and thirty-five degree with sigma three axis but remains indetermina te with respect to sigma one and sigma two that is the reason i said it may be something any position and it is be difficult to determine or indeterminate refer slide t ime one thousand, eight hundred and twenty-five so we move forward to our next topic next topic shear stress is to some exte nt introduced if you are interested more about this we can easily have a look this topic is to some extent also related to shear stresses so it is a nice visualization like the stress ellipsoid lame is a stress ellipsoid we have seen in the last class o r the last lecture so here what we see let us see let the frame of reference be again chosen along sigma one sigma two and sigma three axis we are choosing those as the axis and a plane that is equally inclined to that to these three axis is called an octahedral p lane this is a also used in some book for equilibrium equations for surface this plane looks like this plane so if we look at the description what is said that a plane that is equally inclined to these three axis is called an octahedral plane we are talki ng about this plane because this is equally inclined to all the three axis i have not given any axis number it can be easily given following the system what we are doing this is x this is y and this is z so following this we can say that this is the octahe dral plane and such a plane will have n x n y n z equal definitely it has to be equal because it is inclined to same way in the to the axis and definitely to for a cartesian system that this has to follow an octahedral plane will be defined as plus minus one by root three there are eight such planes now it becomes difficult to imagine why eight such planes let us try to observe say this is the plane which is xz and we also have one more plane better to change the color ok one more plane is bisecting it perpe ndicular way and that plane we can say that this is zy plane now we can imagine one more plane in the cartesian coordinate system which is something like this now with this notation with this drawing we can easily imagine that and this may be this is the n what which plane this is then xy plane so which quadrant we have drawn here this quadrant this quadrant is this quadrant we have drawn we have talked about this octahedral plane yellow is not visible at all anyway it is there so similar to that we can have so there are eight quadrants in three dimension and we can find out that is the reason here it is said that there are eight such planes so this is in one quadrant and similar way we can have eight quadrants because that is created by three mutually perpendicular pl anes and that may have three quadrants so let us go to the to the visualization or octahedral states what we are we are discussing the normal and shear stresses on these planes are called the octahedral normal stress and octahedral shear stress respectively now from the previous equations what we have already derived the sigma we can easily find out putting those values for the sigma n n and sigma n or sigma n n that becomes sigma one one third of sigma one sigma two sigma three and that is what is written here a s i one that is the stress first stress invariant this first stress invariant is also introduced in the last week and it is said why it is said invariant because irrespective of coordinate system it remains same so whatever way the it is stressed whateve r value the stress system it means external load it remains same then in any condition the sigma one sigma two sigma three also remains same and the sum of those three is also a constant known as the first stress invariant or i one sometimes this is also given as a one in some books so but both are same refer slide t ime two thousand, five hundred and fifty-eight so the octahedral stresses we have this is what we have and the tau the shear stresses the normal stress is this and the shear stress we can find out substituting the values of direction cosin es in this equation and what we can find out that the tau is equals to this and in do simple maths we have nine tau octahedral shear stress square is equals to two into i square or the first invariant square plus six into this is the second invariant if you lo ok at the equation in the previous class this is the second invariant i two or a two there it is given as a two and that simplifies to that tau octahedral is equals to root two by three root over i one square three i two so that two is taken outside nine is coming so it is there is no such problem and those eight planes are drawn here to give you the understanding in those octahedral planes the normal and shear stresses are having some invariant value because it is a combination of invariant so that those values always remains const ant on those planes normal and shear stresses and that makes an interesting observation sometimes for some material property determination we need to evaluate this so for a better visualization what is what we can do we can mark the access system here so if we mark the axis system here this is the first octahedral plane what we have already seen and the remaining are quite visible from there so with this if in a state of stress the first invariant is equals to zero that means the octahedral normal stre ss is equals to zero and only the shear stresses will act normal stress on the octahedral plane equals zero it may happen that in some cases the first invariant if it is zero there only the shear stresses will act some example i have drawn a typical case in two dimension i have drawn for pure shear so there was no normal stress acting so that type of pure shear may act this is an important from the point of view of strength and failure of some material so that pure shear sometimes govern the material property a nd that is the reason we need to find out this and we need to check whether the pure shear condition in three dimensional stress concept is with sustained by the material or not and or how much it can sustain refer slide t ime two thousand, nine hundred and fifteen so with that same note we have come to the end of the lecture today the books are remain same that is why it has been written there refer slide t ime two thousand, nine hundred and twenty-nine all the text whatever i have covered so far or may be covering in future slides all are taken from some books either this book or that book so i would suggest if you do not find and it is difficult to pinpoint what is taken from what which book it is sometimes a mix of different books that is the reason i would suggest you follow those books if required and with that i thank you for attending todays lecture and we will meet again with our next lecture soon thank you"}

professor anup ghosh from aerospace enginee ring iit kharagpur we are at the beginning of the module six or the 6th week in sequence the lecture number is twenty-eight we have covered in last week lectures last module lectures different way the stress and in this week we will cover strain as well as we will solve a few problems to give you some insight about the analysis so we will discuss more on strain this is this is very important lecture the lecture may be may outcome to a very small lecture but it is very important i would suggest if you are in the p rocess of learning or in advance studies better you remember this particular lecture it will help you definitely it will help you with that note let us move forward and as we move forward the first slide comes with the recapitulation refer slide t ime one hundred and thirty-nine it is always i feel to better to recapitulate that helps to memorize things gives us the reminder what you have learned all already and as a whole at the end of the course you will see if you look at this and attend this few seconds you will find that you can visualize the total course very well and that helps that really helps not a big deal but really helps i have learned this from a very renowned profession i am lucky to learn things from him anyway so we have learned history of aircraft or aviation to some extent and we have learned how physicist has developed the subject of mechanics solid mechanics and from there how the structural analysis has come up in mathematical approach was the first approach that we have already started we have s tarted in last week as well as in the last to last week while we have discussed about complementary strain and energy strain energy and total potential energy everything we started and those are the basic things where from the total subject has evolved t o do to the date what we have learned various types of external load is the next topic we have covered for experienced by aircraft and how those loads vary in different condition while it is in runway or is its airborne or maybe during landing and we hav e also learned the flight envelope load factors we have we have also learned shear stress bending moments experienced by an aircraft we have learned three dimensional structures like trusses and in the last week that is just in the last week what we have le arned is that about stress how the stresses are we have come across different types of stresses components of stresses for isotropic stress we have come across six components finally considering the complementary shear stresses to be equal initially it was nine components and then we have come across of different orientations transformations from transformation we have seen that we can find a coordinate system or a set of set of stress sigma one sigma two sigma three which are normal stresses were known as principal stresses where in those particular planes where those are acting there is no shear stress and from there we have come across about shear stress also at any plane and we have come across good examples like octahedral stress and also we have come across about the stress ellipsoid so those things you have learned we have learned in the last week with that note we will move forward to the definition of strain and this week we will be covering mainly the strain this is what already we have seen refer slide t ime zero five hundred and fifteen so what we are going to do is the strain introduction to strain we will be doing and i will try to introduce the strain with as much detail as possible in different books it has been introduced in different way i will try to follow a gen eral approach with a concept of vectors and tensors let us see how do we understand that refer slide t ime zero five hundred and fifty-four so in this it is again some mistake with the interpretation of slide these are all vectors so with that note let us start our discussio n this figure is really interesting figure what we are trying to see is that a vector is there as r the tip of that vector is p and an incremental length of that p vector is q which is given by dr and we see that we are conside ring that that amplitude dr is equals to d s now we also define dr star please consider that thing for misrepresentation in digital media similarly we are considering that after deformation deformation means it is under stress from external system and because of the stress that r vector has come here and that p has changed position to p and q has p star and the q of r has changed position to q star and please look at that there is twisting and all other possible change of lengths as far as possible is represented in this figure the overall this figure is changed it is twisted it is length is increased all those things all possible ways we have put here and from general consideration since you are introduced with the components of stresses we can easily imagine that that many com ponents of strains are also there and we define that this r vector as the r p as x p i x p j x p k or x one x two x three as i j k using the unit vector now as it is said there i mentioned that delta r is a is an increment from here and that is the point q x dx i is the are the two points to a distance of dr apart and that dr apart these two points are changing to these two points dr changes to dr star and because of that the displacement involved is here is u and here is u delta u let us try to see what happens this is a general discussion on the direction cosines involved and we will be using the direction coefficients that is the reason direction cosines of p q are lambda one lambda two lambda three sometimes it is given by l m n sometimes if it is unit n one into n three all those way it is given and thus the reason it is given as dr is ds the x y z as it is can be said x one x two x x one x two x three here and similar way we define those in a general way we define this way dx i is equals to lambda ds after deformation the displaceme nt of p from p to p star this we have said and u is u i u y where you are one again it is some similar terms are introduced here though we will be using mostly the tonsorial way but these terms are introduced these these or these are introduced to give you the correlation with the already experienced or learned system we are bringing back all those things again and again so in that way one two three represents u v and w are known as engineering notations and displacement of q is as we mentioned u u star is equ als to u delta u so with this understanding of the system and positions and vectors direction cosines we move forward to the next slide refer slide t ime one thousand and fifty-seven all vectors are now ownerless so we need to erase those vectors are erased now what we have is that this is the increment u star yes it has gone back that is the problem so u star as we have seen that is getting increment with respect to the coordinate system or that is the way this is the gradient in that particular direction of x one and tha t is why the dx change is given as del u one by del x one del u two by del x two by dx two in the y direction x direction y direction and z direction in three orthogonal direction we are get giving the increment and that is consisting of the du portion and then du get s redefined in this term this way as the separate increments of that particular direction or three orthogonal cartesian directions and accordingly what we have is that u star i u i is equals to this so with this what we have which represents the relative d isplacement between the two neighboring point p and q a small line element dr before deformation deform to dr star this we are repeating then the magnitude has changed from ds to ds star and from the usual definition of strain this is has come close pleas e excuse me if we define epsilon is equals to change of length by original length that gives us ds star ds divided by ds and a simple algebraic one if we do in both sides we get this relation which gives that that ds star or the changed length this lengt h is equals to one epsilon multiplied by the ds the original length now ds star amplitude if you talking about is nothing but the dot product of these two p q and d r star and dr star so what we can do is let us see how can we define that p q refer slide time one thousand, four hundred and thirty-eight so this is star component this is star component that is the reason we will come there so p q star what we have found is that r q a vector i have not drawn from here to here and a vector r p star that is from here to here that is the differ ence will give me that p s star q star vector so that is written here and it is exponent as r p dr and u delta u and this is the rq what we see and this is the rp what we see and if this the common terms cancels out and we have that this is equals to dr du and actually while we substitute the values of this what we have is that this is equals to dot product of these two or in the other way if we see that this is this is equals to p star q star dot p star q star dot so this we have as this expression a nd those expressions are substituted here and the previous slide what we have already found out that is put here and what we see is that i have skipped some steps in this because that is a completely tensorial notation of multiplying two incremental vecto rs we need to already you see some are introduced kronecker delta because of the dot product is already introduced and because of the introduction of that dummy variable k l all these things there is a complicated tonsorial calculus is involved thus the reason i have jumped those few steps and why if we see we get if we carry out this we get these equations and the equation becomes that del x dx i multiplied by dx i or square of it we generally do not write a square in that sense so the other component s becomes del u del u i del x j del u j del x i del u k del x i del u k del x j these two are repeated so if these two are repeated what happens i will have summation over that but before that let us see how does th eses get modified for with respect to the le ft hand side so now ds can easily be divided on the right hand side and we can have that this is equals to lambda i into lambda i and this is also lambda i and lambda j this is x i and x j that is there is an i j and this is x i and multiplication of thi s or something like cos square theta cos square alpha cos square beta cos square gamma is equals to one so following that for three dimensional case we have direction equations summation of those equals to zero this and this cancels out the remaining term i s twice e epsilon two twice epsilon epsilon square is equals to this term so finally what we see is that we considered a vector r and that vector is changed position to here as the final r vector with p star and associated increment of that particular v ector dr is also changed to dr star and that thing we have found out that what is the strain this is the strain from here ds star square we have found out and ds star square is nothing but this p q dot product of these two and those two vectors we have found out dot product using the tensor calculus and we come across some relation with respect to the strain and displacement variables involving u y u j and u k sorry u i j where i j varying from one to three so with that note we move forward to the next slide refer slide t ime two thousand and thirty yes this is what we have seen in our last slide it is written in a very clean way now epsilon square may be neglected as a very small value please consider this epsilon and this epsilon as same these are two font problem only so if this is neglected because very small terms if made square that contributes a very very small way that is the reason that is neglected and if we express that epsilon is equals to epsilon i j lambda i lambda j what we can see that this epsilon i j is equa ls to half of u i j that means the derivative of u i with respect to j derivative of u j with respect to i and derivative of u k with respect to i multiplied by this and summation t understand this tonsorial notation one example is carried out in this example i and j is considered as one one so what happens half remains outside as half this is one one that means del u one del u del i or del x i this is said that del u again same quantity because both are same and they are here we have summation of those these are since it is one one all are coming as square but it is not always the same way we can elaborate it we can experience it so i would suggest you may consider that as a homework if we elaborate this as a tensorial notation putting i and j one two three and k is d efinitely sum over i j and since it is repeated we need to consider those as sum of those two terms let u one equals to u u two equals to v and u three equals to w then same expression becomes this expression so it is in index notation one two three it is in cartesian notation or x y z notation u v w are the displacement fields and derivatives are taken with respect to x and x x is defined this way now here it is better to introduce that probably you were introduced with the term that epsa x x s is equals to del u del x where from this term comes this is what we get because of consideration of that particular generic case of strain derivation we considered any type of movement and we have in that way we have considered some higher order terms or non linear terms so this part of strain is generally known as the non linear strain and this is the known as the linear strain refer slide t ime two thousand, four hundred and thirty so in a general way if we write it down what it looks like let us say if it is some shear strain to be denoted so like t hat epsa x x considering one two also you can find out and as i said it is does not is a square it is sometimes this way written and in general epsa x y is something like half of del u del y del v del x that is what we are familiar with but this terms are co ming here as the non linear terms for linear theory we generally do not consider those terms and it becomes something like epsa x x equals to del u del epsa y y is del v del y it says that del w del del z and x y is equals to half of del u del y del v d el x and similarly we can write the other strain components also where there is a good relation between these two epsa and it is known as a gamma one two is known as the engineering strain and epsilon two is known as tensor component of strain so please keep it in mind generally these two convention is followed either epsilon or gamma is used and with this notation we will again yes please stop please recording it is multiplication yes to stop fl two thousand, six hundred and five last slide what i have written yes here it is written squar e is considered there it is written yes good pointed out good pointing out so better to repeat this slide fl two thousand, six hundred and twenty-seven to two thousand, seven hundred and forty-four so with the generic derivation of strain we have already seen the epsilon x x considering from the index or tensorial notation to the cartesian notation how does it changes to epsilon xx in case of epsilon xy or the shear strain similar way we can derive from the index notation what is the expression comes it comes as half of del u del y del v del x and this is not plus please n ote that it is a typographical mistake this is multiplication this is also multiplication and this is also multiplication do not think that it is deleted this plus signs have come by mistake but actually if you observe the previous expression you can is also easily get but for correction purpose it has been corrected here and what we do we move forward considering this particular portion or the non linear portion as it is said to be discarded for linear theory and most of the derivations most of the work whatever we do we follow the linear theory and probably our world is running following the linear theory whatever engineering design in general we do we consider linear theories nonlinear theories are still in research state implementation probably is there in some cases but it is not may be very high precision strain wherever it is required or the material which is a which shows too much deformations along with nonlinearity in its deflection in those cases we need to consider but those are rare cas es we really do not need to consider one very specific example may be the inflatable structure people are using but anyway those things are very very high topic of discussion better not to bring here at this stage so anyway what we see is that with linear theory it reduces to very easy expressions epsa x x is d el u del x if so y by del v del y epsilon z del w del z and epsilon x y is equals to half of del u del y del v del x similarly the y z you can do and z x also you can do is corresponding u v and w are all these variables will change and corresponding one more notation is generally followed that is half of gamma twelve where gamma twelve is known as the engineering strand and epsilon twelve is known as the tensor component of strain refer slide t ime three thousand and forty-three so we move forward so we come across to the last slide it is better to remember this slide this slide is very very useful wherever whatever we do you may like to remember along with the nonlinear terms or you may like to remember without the non linear terms but it is better to remember this if you remember all this up to this it there is not a big deal to remember the remaining portion so this is what the strain is defined including the non linear portion and it is only with the linear terms so with that note let us conclude today \u2019s lecture refer slide t ime three thousand, one hundred and fifty-one refer slide t ime three thousand, one hundred and fifty reference slides are same and we come back to what we have learnt slide and that learnt slide we have learned linear and learned non linear strain deriva tion with respect to the displacement strain displacement relation is learned now we will go further with different compatibility equation of strain and will solve problems in our future lecture so with that i thank you for attending this class this lec ture will meet again in the next lecture to start or to talk more about strain and problems thank you"}
{"audio_filepath": "/media/rishu/Data1/Code Playground/test_ai4b/wav/29.wav", "duration": 2067.86, "text": "enty-nine introduction to strain equations of compatibility welcome back to aircraft structures one this is professor anup ghosh from aerospace engineering iit kharagpur we are in continuation of the 6th week lectures this is in that sequence the 29th in the last class we are already introduced with the derivation of strain more popularly that is the terminology use derivation of strain but actually that is also known in the words like a strain displacement relation so with respect to displacement how strain is defined that we have done we have done considering a mathematical approach not considering a visual approach like many other books have presented may be considering two dimensional then going to three dimensional what we have done we have considered a vector approach or beta to say tenso r approach and then using the tonsorial notations a tensor calculus we have found out the ex pression for strain in that process it is good that we have got the expression including higher order terms that is the nonlinear part of the strain displacement relation nonlinear part of the strain displacement relation is in general not required p robably for discussion of the stage you are going through but it is better always to get introduced with the non linear part also because we should not keep in mind that all relations of strain and displacement are always linear there are cases for larg e deflection especially we need to consider the nonlinear part so in those cases where we need we need to consider but the discussions on theory of elasticity or the type of problem what we generally solve in this stage of study is concerning about linear part of strength so with that definition of linear part of strain which is also ij is equals to half of del u i del j we will come to that better refer slide t ime zero three hundred and thirteen before that we go into the recapitulation slide this helps a lot about what we have already covered in the course we have covered history of aircraft as well as solid mechanics or structural analysis all these things what we are covering in the last during the last week and also this week those things how those got developed by one after another big physicist that we have to some extent in a very brief way we have discussed then we have come across the various types of external loads encountered by an aircraft and then we have come across to the conceptual structural details how it is fabricated why thin structure where how is it done why asymmetric structures come all those things are discussed and then we have discussed about the loads load factors flight envelop those points we have discussed we have come across to a good metho d of unit load consideration for analyzing structure whole structure in the sense we have we have divided the whole structure in wing as well as in fuselage and then wing and fuse larger is separately analyzed for bending moment and shear force distribu tion we have drawn those shear force and binding movement distribution considering a typical case then we have come across with to the cases of space structures solid we have solved landing gear problems then in last week we got introduced to the theor y of elasticity definition of a stress and in the last lecture two definition of strain it is not that theory of elasticity has not been introduced to you earlier but this portion of the course what we are trying is to cover the theory of elasticity from three dimensional point of view or from the visible possible orientation or dimensions of any structures and its loading and the stresses what it encounters so in that sequel we have defined stress we have come across with equilibrium equation equilibrium eq uations with respect to the body force with respect to the surface forces then we got introduced with the stress transformation how stress is transformed along with little bit of a coordinate transformation so and then we found that there is a plane on w hich no shear stress act and not only one plane there are two more orthogonal planes to the parent planes so there are three planes where only normal stresses act and no shear stresses act on that those planes and those stresses are defined as the principal str esses along with that we also found the shear stresses maximum shear stresses we found and then got introduced to the strain in last lecture and today we will go further with the definition of strain refer slide t ime zero seven hundred and twenty-one what we need to do is toda ys main topic of discussion will cover the compatibility equation compatibility equation is really very very interesting one refer slide t ime zero seven hundred and thirty-six we will have many things written with help of those written scripts and other things we will try to have why compatibility equations are required and what is compatibility we are talking about what type of compatibility we are talking about that we need to discuss that we need to see so as i was defining i thought of saying orally but it is very diff icult to say orally the expression of strain with respect to displacement so eps a ij is equals to half of u i j u j i that is u i with respect to t to the partial derivation of j and then u j with respect to i where i j is varying for one two and three so tha t is generally written but sometimes it is not because our purview of analysis is within that domain only so in that sense it may not be mentioned always we may always consider that i and j is equals to one two and three so we get six components of strain epsilon x x epsilon y y so all the six components we can easily get sometimes to keep a conformity sometimes this is also written as x y z with respect to the cartesian system so um if u i are given as continuous function of x i we can readily compute epsilon i j so that is the reason sometimes x i it is written sometimes instead of x y z this is also said as x one x two x three that is the reason it is said x i so with res respect to to x i we can readily compute the epsilon i j because this we can easily put in this expression we can we can find out what is what are the six components of strains we can easily find it out on the other hand epsa ij or epsilon ij are given as function of x one x two x three then we cannot uniquely determine ui because we have six equations in epsilon ij but there are displacement but three displacement components this three displacement components six this so that is the reason we cannot find it out in unique manner so we need to have some relation between the this components to satisfy maybe in terms of in t erms of strains strain components so that it becomes unique that is the point what we say from mathematical point of view while it got derived it was a from mathematical point of view only it got derived so that was the first reason to say that it shoul d hold some this is the basic reason to hold some but later the physical representation physical continuity and those things are talked about later let us see the displacement u i must be continuous and single valued it has to be that is the other requir ement to keep this reverse relation satisfying that single value unless it is single valued we may have a strain while derived from the same expression considering some part will give some value or maybe some other value considering some other parts so that may create anomalies it wo uld not be conforming to the existing or physical system so this has to be continuous and single valued in order to obtain a unique solution as discussed in one and also satisfying the requirement as discussed in two you must s atisfy certain conditions those are the compatibility epsa ij must ensure continuous displacement that is compatibility condition of strength continuous displacements continuous for how much that is in which way what is happening you please try to observ e say we better always we consider a simple structures example say i have a cantilever beam and it is loaded at tip by p what will happen this structure will bend like this now the displacement slope these parameters are always continuous along this leng th of the beam but while we define mathematically that may not be so if it is not that will create the problem so these are some points what mathematically says that that continuity must hold and that continuity to hold we must satisfy a set of equatio ns known as compatibility to keep it unique the solution or relation between x one x two x three and the six strain components that is where the compatibility equations come but in general we do not need those equations to discuss much because the assumption or ty pe of solutions problems we solved those are already solved by many people and these things are already satisfied so we need not to think much about these things so with this idea of equations of compatibility or compatibility condition let us move forwar d refer slide t ime one thousand, five hundred and twenty-six all equations this derivation i would say is available in almost all books it is too mathematical there here also it is too mathematical you only need to be an expert of partial derivation and algebraic equation what i say o bserving algebraic equation and rearranging those equations to the desired form or desired expression way so in that form we would like to have establish the relations why these are the relations that is rarely proved in a book i will also try to skip t hose that part in this context that probably comes in very higher mathematics or continuum mechanics domain of analysis or in mathematics so those things we would not say but what we would say that the compatibility equations what we see this one two three four five six how do we get one or two we will discuss and we will say that the other may be obtained following a similar way if you are not able to obtain there are good books available very popular good books or almost all books it is available i would suggest you refer those to going to much beyond let us start with the expression of shear strain gamma xy gamma xy as usual with respect to that if we do half goes with the if you compare with the previous one that is for epsilon we have already established a relation that epsilon is equals to half gamma so from there half gets cancelled and we get this expression del v del x plus del u del y now what we do we do twice the partial derivative with respect to x and y and the right hand side gets modified this way this line from mathematical point of view is very very important since the function u we are continuous we may write we are changing the derivative sequence of derivation so this thing usually comes in higher mathematics or you have probably covered in your highe r mathematics course so what we get is that the right hand side gets a little bit modified del two del x two equals to del v del y del two del y two equal multiplied by del u del x so this we can easily say already defined as epsa yy or epsilon y y and this is epsa xx so we have a relation between the gamma and two epsilon so this is the first compatibility equations so following this if we start with this gamma y z easily you can come to this if we if we start with this easily you can come to this it is not a big issue to solve it similar way if you start with this expression or epsilon x x is equals to del u del x and then do these two see it is the other two y z if we do this derivation and substitute all these x these expressions are the other expressions wha tever you have got and rearrange those you will easily get the expressions for this so please look at the compatibility conditions compatibility equations these three equations establish a relation between the shear and the normal shear strain and the normal strain and this set of equations on the left hand side with the normal strain to the shear strain so once this equations are satisfied we have unique solution for the strain with the assumptio n of displacement function that i s the reason it is important and we need to satisfy this condition whenever we are solving any problem following elasticity approach not only in elasticity approach say when we go for the process of solution of numerical methods do not think there it is not satisfied numerical meth ods are fundamentally rooted to these theory of elasticity and they are whatever the displacement functions are chosen those satisfy this condition and from there the derivation is done and those are approximate because it is considered piecewise satisfac tion of these equations and that is the reason as a whole while we go it gives us approximate solution refer slide t ime two thousand, one hundred and nineteen so we come to a specific case known as plane strain condition plane stress you are already introduced it is similar to plan e stress in that case say z components of sigma was zero here z component of epsilon r zero that i s what we mathematically say it is easy to remember that way that is why we say it frequently but problem wise it is a different type of problem in case of plane stress problem we say that the surfaces which are free those are the z direction and in case of of plane strain where the surfaces we are confined or restricted to expand or contract those surfaces or that direction is considered epsa zz so with that we let us see how the equations are modified equations modifications are not much to do only these things we are supposed to substitute we are supposed to substitute in the previous relations whatever we have got for the strain displacement relation as well as the compatibility condition and we get th ese values so the particles of the body suffer displacement in one plane only let the plane be x y we say that it is a plane strain problem the other way i said i told you that in the z dimension it is restric ted or restrained to strain so no expansion or contraction is allowed in that direction so accordingly the compatibility equations we get now this is a good discussion whether we have got many equations is not it i have tried to give you small less num ber of equations but up to some limit i cannot restrict myself i have to give so anyway let us see what we have and what we need more so the stress strain relationship if we talk about why do we need the stress strain relationship that is what is briefed here in this things till now we get equations of equilibrium three strain displacement relations six equations compatibility equations are an expression of compatibility of displacement which we must have or maintain so those are not something relating in re lation to the unknown and the known things and number of equati ons so that cannot be used that i s what we said so similarly if we consider that so total we have three six independent equations so number of unknowns what we have described using those equatio ns are six components of stresses six components of strain and displacement three components so there is a shortcut so six more relations we need that six more relations will come from the stress strain relationship so we must have an additional six equation to obtai n a complete elasticity solution this we get from the stress strain relations so we move forward to stress strain relation that is a very easy stuff i would not spend much time on that refer slide t ime two thousand, five hundred and thirty-one but before we go for before we go for the stress strain relation it is time to have some definitions probably you are aware of this definition for better to remind those so anybody under consideration will be assumed to occupy all the space within the boundary surface such idealization of matte r is called the continuous media or continuum this may be visualized something like that say i visualize this way say you have a bubble inside a rubber or eraser what you usually use and if you stretch it many times you see that while it is in normal co ndition you do not see that bubble but while you stretch it you observe that bubble that makes it not a continuous media so something like that if it is there are discontinuities so this continuous assumption is not holding elastic body it is a if a str ained body can recover completely to its original state of shape the body is called an elastic body please note its original state or shape if a strained body cannot recover completely to its state or shape the body is said to be plastic state so that i s the basic definition so this may relations we will talk about in next slide homogeneous body if a body possesses the same property everywhere in the body that is a homogeneous body that means any sample we take that shows the same property that is why we say it homogeneous and isotropic isotropic is the properties in all directions are the same at a point all directions we have we have talked about only three directions so in the all the three possible directions or maybe any if you rotate whatever the way you like the axis system in any direction the properties are same so we call that as isotropic is if not we call it anisotropic orthotropic there are many others categories we wo uld not discuss those things those are generally discussed in other subjects in more detail in general we shall consider bodies to be elastic homogeneous and isotropic continuous that is what we our all elasticity problems what we are discussing is based on so on these uh definitions we will define the stress strain relation refer slide t ime two thousand, eight hundred and fifty-four so the stress strain relation we come across is this is what is new in this right why did i discuss the previous slide the previous slide is the basis previous definitions are the basis of these assumptions or say i should say it is not assumption this property hooke\u2019s law epsilon xx is equals to sigma x x divided by e very well known e is modulus of elasticity see here one more thing you must note in the previous one we talked about elastic that means which recovers but it ma y recover in a linear manner or in a non linear manner so whether e is constant during the process or not that is a big concern our discussion is again within the limit where we have e is a straight line that this is sigma this is epsilon and the slope is e so our per view or discussion is in that region so epsilon xx accompanied by lateral strain epsilo n yyy equals to nu sigma x by epsilon this is easy to write sometimes i visualize in the way that it is very easy if we i used to play in my still i play with eraser is a very soft piece of rubber many things are easy to visualize there so you can easily observe that if you pull the eraser or the rubber block it contracts from the transverse two directions why it contracts that is because of the poisons ratio and that is the reason the minus is there that ratio of contraction is given by this poisons ratio these are already introduced to you so better not to spend much time but i like to bring that example that is why i am talking about that so with thi s thing with this scenario we can easily write this equations because if a body is under stress of sigma x sigma y and sigma z or sigma xx sigma yy or and sigma zz we can easily say that one by e multiplied by sigma x mu into sigma y by sigma zz and simi larly we can write the other two normal strain components and the shear strain components we can easily write considering g as the modulus of rigidity as gamma xy is equals to tau xy by g and so on these are easy equation probably in mechanics many times p eople introduce this without giving the background and other things i think no harm in that so we are repeating the same equation we have come across to some relation in the previous slide e and g relations are written i did not say it very clearly this relation you can you can easily as i said i have skipped that part you can easily prove that following some two dimensional case of strain where a block is tilted because of shear strain and then put those values and easily you can find it out so i do not want to spend much time g is equals to e by two into one nu so one more constant is there that we can easily discuss in relation to that and with that will conclude todays lecture refer slide t ime three thousand, three hundred and three so what we can do if we sum all the components of normal stresses we get the equations as we see here and if we take it out uh this portion sigma xx sigma yy and sigma z z then we can have an expression something like that e will define what is e e is equals to one two nu by e and in this particular c ase if we consider that all these components are equal and that is p or its a compression from all size side or it is a hydrostatic pressure hydrostatic pressure is easy to visualize again while we keep something under water so from all the surfaces the body if it is considerably small in size with respect to the depth of the water it experiences hydrostatic pressure or equal pressure from all the sides or you may need to do something else to visualize and we can have those type of environment for experi ments but anyway if we put those we get the relation something like this and this constant in relation to e is known as the bulk modulus or modulus of volume expansion so with this small definition we would like to conclude the lecture with compatibility refer slide t ime three thousand, four hundred and thirty-six refer slide t ime three thousand, four hundred and thirty-nine and the standard references come and whatever we have learned that is what is it are reiterated here please keep a note of that and then with that i thank you for attending todays lecture we will meet again with some more concept of problem solving thank you"}

one course m yself anup ghosh from aerospace enginee ring department iit kharagpur w e were in the proces s of introduction to the course w e have already covered two things in the first few minutes or say a bout half an hour w e have observed how the theory has progressed not only the theory we started with an example an example of leonardo da vinci how he did his first experiment to find out the strength of wire and gradually we have seen how newt on played his role in the study t hen there are many other scientists like bernoulli like euler and then hodge crandall t hey have laid t he path of the theory of elasticity t hen we ended with the discussion of the recent days work in the shell with donnell\u2019s work and then the lecture following that was consisting of the history of how the aircraft or aviation industry has come into the present day the first controllable flight was on 17th december one thousand, nine hundred and three at kitty hawk by wright brothers then from there we have aircraft to carry more than six hundred probably more than eight hundred passengers and we have an airc raft to carry probably anything maybe a few wagon s of the railway s o those who have seen how the slow progress has come up in between how rotorcraft has come in and then today what we will do we will be again discussing a few aspects related to aircraf t structures in considera tion to the existing structures refer slide time three hundred and seven before we go for any analysis or understanding of any structure i think it is better to understand what it is how it is s o we that will have to some exten t discussed about any structure loadbearing structure which beers load and in case of aircraft how big it is it can be and how small it can be how much payload it is sup posed to carry all those things that are the reason we have said here that where how what of the aircraft structure so if we see these things we will discuss we will also discuss about the concept of construction as a structure these things will discuss s o better we take a few example s of aircraft and try to discuss how the structure is important and where we need to pa y more attention as a structure refer slide time four hundred and thirty-eight so the first example what we will consider is really a huge aircraft that is the antonov two hundred and twenty-five an225 is also known as i n this lecture we will cover an overview of the existing aircra fts from its size consideration structures consideration from an external way we would not go into detail about internal structures s o a photograph unless we have a comparison it is very difficult to understand how big it is so from here also that is missing probably we have on the farce a few aircr aft so we have the runway scene but that also is not very good observation to i magine the size of the aircraft refer slide time five hundred and thirty-eight here the gross takeoff weight if we look at that gross takeoff weight is about six hundred and forty thousand kg and empty weight is about two hundred and eighty thousand kg and a wingspan that is very important wingspan is about eight hundred and eighty-four meter t his gives you some idea of how big it is if you look at how big it is it is better to noti ce that a standard soccer field a football field is about one hundred meter to one hundred and twenty meter so an aircraft if we can imagine is standing on that field its wingspan from here to here is covering almost the length of the football field probably if somebody wants to play h ere a small soccer game probably maybe played on this portio n that gives us how big the aircraft is okay that is about the span w e understand it is so big at about the height of one hundred and eighty-one meter one hundred and eighty-one meter in the standard way if we look at in our surroundi ng if we see we generally compare with our known objects as generally we consider that a single stor ey of a house is about three meters sometimes it is less sometimes it is more but it is about three meter so if i divide it this number it comes about six storey building s o you just try to imagine you are just at the foot of a multi storied building and the height of this aircraft is about six storey so it is so huge inside some other ideas if we have all these views will come into slowly cargo hold capaci ty t his is particularly a cargo aircraft s o cargo hold capacity if we look at it is one thousand, three hundred meter cube sorry for this mistake or say forty-six thousand cubic feet and it s width is about sixty-four meter again sixty-four meter means about how much about say two table tennis boar d if you keep side by side it is little more than that so it may be about the width of your classroom generally where you sit for a class and the height is about forty-four meter t hat means inside it is about one and half storey height and long it is about four thousand, three hundred and thirty-five meters that means almost a bout half of the football field s o it is better to notice it is so huge if it is so huge it has to be light also to carry all those cargo cargo weight is not directly a subtraction from the gross weight to empty weight because this include s also the weight of the fuel and that determines the range of the aircraft so it is generally a compromise be tween the range and the payload s o accordin gly according to the assignment generally this aircraft is hired according to the payload capacity the range is decided according to the requirement of range in general the fuel is filled and it is used for that particular range refer slide time nine hundred and fifty this is another view this is the top view if we say not top that way it is a kind of skew view from top it is a skew view from bottom if we look at t here are six engines this particular type of configuration of the aircraft is known as two vertical tail and hi gh wing configuration with bogie type of landing here you see these are the two bogie type of landing here and because this tail has come on this side the vertical tail has come on this side that increases the load on the structure because see it is increasing the air load which is coming horizontally on this vertical tail pla ne as a moment component on this horizontal tail plane so that increases the size sectional dimensions or weig ht of the horizontal tail plane but because of some other design requirements probably they have used this type of configuration generally all cargo aircrafts are high wing configuration because the most important thing to remember in cargo aircraft is that how to load the cargo in this case generally the front portion gets lifted there is a hinge here you can find many videos in website in youtube to see ho w the cargo is loaded from front this bogie type of landing gear we need many landing gear to distribute the weight while it is landing because it has to be very soft landing beca use it carries sensitive things probably it was used to carry a few space shuttle so all those things are sensitive things so a shock is not at all desirable it is not at all desirable in another view also other requirements are also there s o keeping in mind all these things generally a bogie type of land ing gear and a high wing configuration is considered refer slide time one thousand, two hundred and nineteen this is another view of that particular aircraft to give you the size so probably i f we stand beside this aircraft our height will be somewhere here up to this much so one human height two three four five six seven eight up to this probably human height is much less than the height of a stor ey so our height probably will be something like this refer slide time one thousand, two hundred and fifty-nine so with this let u s move to some smaller aircraft b asically the structures requirement remain s same in smaller aircraft also t his is also a very famous aircraft breezer b600 which is having a gross takeoff weight of six hundred kg and empty weight of three hundred and eighty-four kg s o this is one thing to notice here we will discuss many other things but weight is very important parameter while we talk about aircraft structure so this is about four hundred kg so just to give you some comparison about weight of a general car a five seater car which is the most popular in our society that comes with thou sand cc capacity that comes about one thousand kg around but this particular at its takeoff weight is about six hundred kg and this three hundred and eighty-four kg this weight is probably equal to some big bikes nowadays that has become a fashion s o it is probably equivalent almo st same to tha t those big bikes weight of those big bikes but this is able to carry about four people including pilot so there is the mileage there is the advantage there is the efficiency required for aircraft structure design so that is what we need to study we w ill have to study and the wingspan wise if we look at about it is about nine meter a gain this is here if you see it is nine meter this is about the span of your classroom maybe so if we try if you open one wall of your classroom probably we can fit in one s uch aircraft it would not be much difficul t so from here to here if we look at it will come into your classroom and height is defin itely less than a storey height it is two hundred and fourteen so just try to imagine you are in a classroom and just beside that there i s an aircraft by which you can fly for a few one hundred kilometers so it is so small so these type of aircrafts are generall y built abroad in us and europe at home these are known as a kind of home built aircraft also but we do not have our government does n ot give that type of permission so we cannot build it anyway let us progress probably in future government will permit so it is your scope you learn it and probably you will be able to fabricate in flight on your own refer slide time one thousand, five hundred and forty-three next i t is a different view a bout the configuration if we look at this engine is something different t he previous engi ne was a mainly turbofan engine this is a piston prop engine piston prop engine means it is similar to the engine what you use in your car or in your motorbike only it has a different configuration inside its orientation is different so that it can exert that much power engine capacity is also probably more than those and this is a low wing configuration t his also gives us that this is a semi monocoque type configuration that means it is not only the skin which is bearing the load there are some frames like this like these frames which also bears load refer slide time one six hundred and thirty-one this has three landing gears an d these landing gears are fi xed these are not retractable landing gear retractable landing gears increase the weight beca use that needs hydraulics to do so these types of aircrafts are generally does not come with retractable landing gear so along with this concept we will see we will go forward refer slide time one thousand, seven hundred and three this is another view it is almost from the front and this type of tail plane configuration is very common tail plane also withstands t he load to control the aircraft t he wing is on which the total portion hangs while it is on air so the wing root is very important structure in that se nse t here is a wing box structure wing joining structure inside which joins the wing with the fuselage and while it is on the ground the load comes from the landing gear an d that landing gear has to be refer slide time one thousand, seven hundred and forty-six this is another view we see here there is a dihedral this is the wing root and it goes up so this much is the dihedral on the other view also you can see but where the tail plane is not having any dihedral the three landing gears we see t his is the portion of rudder refer slide time one thousand, eight hundred and eight this is the top view f rom this view we see a diff erent way how does it look like s o let us go move forward to some other aircraft refer slide time one thousand, eight hundred and eighteen okay before we move forward to some other aircrafts see getting details of internal structures is a really difficult task because nobody gives it because they are doing business and they do not want somebody else to do it to create competition fortunately this drawing i got it from some open forum shows in a very hybrid mode the internals also here we see the ribs here we see frames these frames work as kind of bulkhead and then those total fuselage is fabricated on that and landing gear is f ixed all other components and equipments are inside and this construction please notice that construction of wing and the tail plane and the ver tical tail plane is almost same t he basic thing is that there are ribs there are spars we w ill come into de tail in the next lecture how does a rib is constructed how does a spar is constructed and those details will come so internally there are so many structural components and on that there is a skin which gives the aerodynamics shape and it transfers the loads to internal structures and as a result we fly it has to be very smooth to reduce the drag that these transitions are made as smooth as possible t his is as i tol d you it is a kind of home built that portion is not that smooth but if you look at the commercial aircrafts or the previous in antonov also you have s een in the future aircraft whatever we will see there also you will see those are made very small to reduce the drag refer slide time two thousand and forty-five this is another wonder of aviation industry a380 so one point i would like to mention here that if you remember in case of an225 or antonov two hundred and twenty-five this was eight hundred and eighty-four i think yes it is eight hundred and eighty-four and here it is seven thousand, nine hundred and seventy-five t his point is very noticeable because the cargo aircrafts are not always used in all internat ional airports runways becaus e it depends on the requirement but all international runways are generally permitted to fly aircraft with eighty meter wing span that is the reason i know from some reliable source that it was a big challenge for airbus to keep this design within that eighty meter wing span limitation you see this is very important point to notice that it is certified for up to eight hundred and sixty-eight passengers j ust try to imagine this is a huge number eight hundred and sixty-eight passengers there are two decks there is division her we wi ll see that type of fuselage we will get introduced to that and the gross takeoff weight is five seventy-five thousand kg empty weight is two hundred and seventy-seven thousand kg and wingspan is about eighty meter height twenty-four meter approximately two thousand, four hundred and nine twenty-four meter means again if we bring to our comparison pa rameter that is the height of a storey height of house height of our buildings so it is three meter if we get it is about six stor ey building so height wise probably it is almo st same as i think this is more point better to note that that was eighteen point so mething this is twenty-four point something so it is about eight storey not six storey so the height is much more than the antonov there the big difference comes because from the landing gear because here the landing gear is not that type of l anding unfortunately landing gear is not in the figure what i have included please refer to the open forum open internet documents you will find that it is because of the landing gear landing gear plays a big role in this height increment so here the retractable landing g ear not the bogie type landing gear that requires some space another differ ence is the engine t here are four engines because the weight wise the payload is small here not only that there is a progress in between on engine capacity also so that is being u tilized by airbus refer slide time two thousand, four hundred and thirty another dream machine they say is dreamliner seven hundred and eighty-seven boeing so the wingspan is noticeable as sixty meter height is about seventeen meter and typical capacity is about two hundred and forty-two passengers s o this is again having engine is reduc ed here again number of engine reduces because of the advance in the or progress in the engine technology size of the engine more latest engines are used and that way it gets reduced so engine thrust has to be transferred to the structure from this t o the wing and then it is to push forward the aircraft so that portion is also to be designed refer slide time two thousand, five hundred and nineteen one more segment of aircraft if we see i am putting you stress on the height and the wingspan because it is better to notice here th e size what we are going to design how big it is so the wingspan is two hundred and twenty-five meter height is six meter so it is about two storey building and span is twenty-two meter this is generally a private cessna c itation latitude these are known as business jet aircrafts these two engines general turbofan engines are mounted at aft portion and that forces to make it a ttail configuration since it is a ttail configuration again as we have discussed in case of antonov that increases load in the vertical tail plane so the re the vertical tail plane was increasing load on the horizontal tail plane and here the horizontal plane is increasing load on the vertical tail plane refer slide time two thousand, six hundred and twenty-six so that structure size as increases that increases weight but this is a d ifferent type of requirement this is a low wing aircraft configuration is also different because it has to be very height is supposed to be kept very low because it operates in small aircrafts also where not always the provision of ladder or staircase is present so keeping in mind all those things this configuration is different keeping in mind the ground clearance distance also it has been made at the low wing configuration and with twenty-two meter wingspan and height of sixty-four meter it is able to probably fly about twenty to passengers but it is inside is generally configured according to the requirement of business requirement refer slide time two thousand, seven hundred and thirty-five now we come to some extent bit detail of the structure so wing to some extent we hav e seen in the previous aircraft h ere is this portion this portion is known as the cargo hold and these circular rings are the bulkheads which joins one to the other these are the window gaps and this deck on which we generally sit chairs are put here from front to the back a nd depending on the requirement of these things a fuselage is constructed this is a door cut out this drawing is not very good but again it is collected from some open forum these supports are to support the deck t his is the deck beam on which the total s itting arrangement is supported we will come at agai n details of those construction s so that is why we do not want to spend much time here refer slide time two thousand, eight hundred and thirty-four again this is the fuselage of that a380 type of fuselage one these cutouts ar e for door t here two decks as i mentioned and this is the cargo hold in a different view all these things are bulkheads circular type of semi elliptical this is semi elliptical cross section type of things and then this is different view of that fuselage construction and we will see in d etail how these things are done we will try to understand analysis criteria how this particular type of structure is analyzed how torsion comes into effect for an aircraft structures how deflection of each and every member and stress bending moments are developed in each and every member and on w hich how we can design a member a ll those things will slowly come in our course so before that it is better to keep in mind this type of st ructures we are going to design the examples what we will be solving are probably not exactly match ing with this type of structure but if we look at simple aircrafts those will definitely match those examples and for more complicated aircraft like this the advanced things are introduce d and accordingly it has been carried out refer slide time three thousand and twenty-six this is another view another solidworks dr awing or cad drawing i must say previous also is a cad drawing t his view is different in this view these bulkheads are quite clear this is the beam w e always put holes in the beams to reduce weight in this structure also you see there are holes to reduce weight and we will see why this window shape has come what was the reason why stress is important around this hole refer slide time three thousand, one hundred and ten then we come to the picture o f a conventional wing structure here this is the spar these two and the se are the ribs this is the leading edge cover this is the trailing edge cover where we do not show the control surfaces t hose details are re ally not available i would suggest you please go to the internet or in the book of peery in the book of bruhn in the book of megson there are figures w e cannot r eproduce directly those figures so this is the kind of cad drawing t his is a cad drawin g of ideological cad drawing drawing which i am showing you as a representation for more detail i would suggest please refer those books as i mentioned t here are few photographs in the new edition in the book of peery you will find lot of photographs in the book of bruhn also you will find lot of photographs in the book of megson also you will find lot of photographs not only that now internet is very open and there you may get many photographs and details of the structural construction refer sl ide time three thousand, two hundred and thirty-two this is a different view from bottom t hese are the rib construction s kin is supposed to be put skin is removed here we see the internal a gain let me mention this is a n ideal construction t his is not exactly the way it is followed we will see some more detail later how the fabrication is done refer slide time three thousand, two hundred and fifty-seven if we look at the references this content is covered from some portion from wikipedia some portion from the applied elasticity by chiteh wang by donald son book by bruhn book by rivello book by megson and peery azar that book refer slide time three thousand, three hundred and twenty-one so what we have learned today is that it is to notice that there is a huge variation of the size of the struct ure what we are going to design we are going to fabricate we are going to understand we are going to make s o in that the wing span whatever the aircraft we have discussed the re it ranges from an aircraft which fits in our classroom to an aircraft which is probably as wide as a football field s o it is about ten times pro bably so please keep in mind that it depends on how it is being operated on that the load is dependant which it is supposed to carry and how it is supposed to carry on that the load is dependant and on that load we are s upposed to de sign the structure h eight is predominantly governed from the other requirements with a narrow bodied or wide bodied it depends also on the aerodynamic conside rations they sometimes govern decide what shoul d be the size and how the cross section should look like and dependin g upon that we try to fabricate but point to note again that it is the approximate diameter we say we cannot say diameter because in none of the case what we have discussed it is the section is circular but again we say diameter because if we approximate to a circular it is the diameter of say twenty-two meter to twenty-four meter so this is really huge huge variation is there dependin g upon the load we are carrying we need to find out we need to fabricate those section find out the dimensi ons of those section g ross takeoff weight varies from as i told you six hundred kg may be equal to a big motorbike to something which is not imaginable at all six hundred and forty thousand kg and empty weight varies from three hundred and eighty-four to two hundred and eighty-five thousand kg so with this better we conclude todays lect ure keeping in mind that the structure what we are going to design structure what we are going to analyze is not a small one it is huge structure s o it is as big as a football field s o if we learn the process to design the small one we will definitel y be able to design bigger one also so with this note let us conclude todays lecture w e will come back with the next phase of lecture again t hank you"}
{"audio_filepath": "/media/rishu/Data1/Code Playground/test_ai4b/wav/30.wav", "duration": 1221.37, "text": "irty formulation of elasticity problems welcome back to aircraft structures one course this is professor anup ghosh from aerospace engineering department iit kharagpur we are in the sixth week lectures in sequence it is it is the thirty lecture we will have covered relations between stress strain strain displacement all these relations we have covered now it is time to solve pro blem but theory of elasticity approach of solving problem is not very well appreciated problem for many so we need to think a lot to solve those problems and people have spent considerable time to find solution for those problems now we are learning pr obably learning is not much difficult much not much time consuming but it is we are continuing with that so what we have done so far we have done so far in the elasticity portion with help of the next slide we will discuss refer slide t ime zero one hundred and thirty-three as a recapitulation slide appears it is relating related to the whole or whatever we have covered in our course till that starting with history of aircraft and aerospace structures or solid mechanics how people started it how leonardo da vinci did his the f irst experiment and then slowly we have come across to many things and to the derivation of cell and other things now various types of after that we have discussed about various types of loads experienced by our structure the aircraft structure in diffe rent condition it experiences different type of load when it is airborne it is not only the loads coming from air and the engine it is it experiences it also experiences body forces or the inertia forces because of the movement maneuver we say there so ma n for maneuvering different type of g forces comes and that is popularly known as that how much g it can withstand or the body force it is experiencing so with respect to that in correlation to g we have also come across to the flight envelope a flight envelope is the envelope for which we define how much a structure should withstand how much g a structure should withstand and it varies from aircraft to aircraft a type of aircraft definitely for a aerobatic aircraft or a fighter aircraft the g experienced is much more than an agricultural aircraft or a civil aviation aircraft or maybe a glider one so keeping in mind those maneuver difficult maneuvers and experience of g a flight envelope is generally prepared and those flight envelope guides us for the d esign now after that bending moment shear force diagram what you have done for different beams probably in your mechanics course for cantilever simply supported many more we have done those things surface and bending moment diagram for wing and fuselage we have considered those separately and we have solved typical problems in association to that we have come across then learn the truss structures in truss structure we have solved landing gear problems in relation to truss and not only landing gear pro blem there are many other three dimensional structures available inside the aircraft so those we may also solve using the approach what we have learned and then we have started discussing the stress strain relations theory of elasticity all those points stress strain in the first week class we have defined stresses we have defined equilibrium equations we have defined transformation of tr uss how do we transform for tr usses from one plane to the other and during that transformation we found that there is a plane where shear stress is equals to zero or in a better way we should say there are three planes orthogonal planes where shear stresses are zero and the normal stresses in those planes are known as the principal stresses those principal stresses follow s ome certain set of invariant property we have three invariants stress invariance and similarly we have strain invariance also but strain invariants we have not discussed it is given you as a scope to explore on your own or the principle strain properties all those things i would suggest you explore on your own and i may go into that but after that the most important thing what we have derived is a related to the strain displacement relation the strain displacement relation we have derived from the tensor calculus approach or with considering vector and tensors and then we got the complete equations of strain displacement including the non linear terms then in the last class we have considering the only the linear part we have come across to the complete compatibility equations compatibility ability equations are important for unique solutions and that has to be maintained so so we we have learned what are the equations and we need to we need to satisfy those conditions for any analysis then the stress strain relations that we are probably already introduced to us we have got some relations and with that scenario let us move forward for today\u2019s topic refer slide t ime zero seven hundred and seven today\u2019s topic or this lectures topic is a formulation of elasticity problem refer slide t ime zero seven hundred and twenty-two so let us look into it how the elasticity problems are formulated formulation of elasticity problems for a three d body so we have we are continuing with the formulation of elasticity problem for a 3d body problem in elasticity we have three equations of equilibrium six equations for strain displacement six equations for stress strain relations total fifteen relations we have we need to solve six stresses six strains three displacements sigma epsilon u v w or x y z and that is also total fifteen so now we are ready with our status to solve it how to solve that is what we will cover now an elasticity problem can be solved however exact solutions are only obtained for some simple problems here lies the key people have tried a lot to solve all the problem s using this mathematical approach and it is really difficult to solve using this mathematical approach all the problems there are a few problems that people have tried and solved and those we will learn and there are two basically ways of solution one is solving the three displacement first and then solving the stresses the other is the reverse way but those we will learn but this actually this as the statements stated here that actually initiates the process of approximate solution and modern day comp utational solution process so involving finite element method not only finite element method finite element method is the probably the first method that is why people say always finite element method there are many other methods similar methods like bou ndary element methods and so on so those approximate methods are invented and using these conditions satisfied these conditions satisfied for a smaller domain they go for the larger domain analysis and using computers and modeling of those solids in a eve n if it is complicated we can solve those problems find out solutions for that and we cannot solve find out solutions for all problems following the elasticity approach but the question may come why then do we need to learn if it is not able to solve be cause the approximate methods what just now i said most popular is find element method nowadays probably people are more referring more with the commercial names those things but fundamental basis of those are also this theory of elasticity from here using some functional analysis approach or some approximate method approach like the rayleigh method or some other functional analysis approach we get the basic equations for the smallest unit and then we assemble those units and get the approximate solutions so how good we approximate the displacement behavior from the theory of elasticity point of view that gives us how accurate we are in finding the solution anyway let us move forward two classes of problems usually we need to determine three unknown displaceme nts or six unknown stresses whatever we do we can do the other using the relations whatever we have in our hand we have fifteen relations is not it in the first category this category problems in the first category problems equilibrium equations are written in terms of strain by expressing six stresses as function of strains equilibrium equations are written in terms of strain the strain displacement relations are then used to form three equations involving three displacements u v and w the boundary conditions fo r this method of solution must be specified as displacement so in this approach this is the way we solve after finding u v and w we can then obtain six strains from strain displacement equations and we find six unknown stresses from the stress strain equati ons note that compatibility is not being used however u v and w are determined directly and they ensure that they are singular valued functions so with this note um as i have already said unless uvw are having single valued function we cannot do that is the reason in many cases after going through the elasticity course many people say that what is the need of compatibility equation because the type of problem we solve that those are already solved by famous physicist and scientist and they have already satisfied the conditions of compatibility we generally many times skip that part we do not show that it is satisfying the compatibility condition but that does not mean that it is not required to be satisfied so please keep it in mind compatibility has to be satisfied so with that note we move forward to have some more discussion on that solution process refer slide t ime one thousand, four hundred and twenty-two in a structural problem our objective is to find the stress distribution in an elastic body produced by an external loading system in this case it is usually more convenient to determine six stresses fast before calculating any required strain or displacement this is done as follows so write six equations of compatibility in terms of stresses so in the second approach to find the stresses first we need to write the compatibility in terms of stresses that is what we will try to do try to see and to do that what we do is simply recall first the equations of stress and strain six equations we have the resulting equations are equat ions are then simplified by making use of the strains relationships developed in the equation of equilibrium the solution of this equations automatically satisfy the condition of compatibility and equilibrium throughout so let u s see how do we do compatib ility in terms of stresses refer slide t ime one thousand, five hundred and fifty-four again to make it simpler to understand it properly we have reduced our domain we have come to the two dimensional problem two dimensional case of a plane stress or strain plane stress or strain we wil l be solving so in this first to consider plane stress in today and strain will be discussed in the next lecture so in case of plane stress as we have already said that in the z direction all the stress components are zero that is sigma z z equals to sin zero and tau xz tau yz are also equals to zero if we put this condition to equilibrium equation it reduces to this xy are the surface forces stress and relation also reduces to this and compatibility this is also with substitution of the other relations we can h ave the stress strain directly with respect to the g is something like this and then we find that although if such z exists compatibility equations are satisfied leaving this equation only so if we substitute all these values and the compatibility equati ons even though the there is a value of f z we can we come across only to this equations to satisfy that is del two gamma xy del x del y is del two epsa y del x two del two epsilon x del y two and then substituting for strain here if we substitute all these str ain components but we have a relation it is again i have skipped that part i did not find it simply copying pasting the equations and to show you i would suggest you simply substitute these equations and get get the equations here substituting this here and get this equation here and then if we move forward with this equation what we have we need to use the remaining one is not it refer slide t ime one thousand, eight hundred and thirty-one so the equilibrium equation the remaining equilibrium equations two and three what we have that we can see and that is taken a derivative refer slide t ime eight thousand, one hundred and forty-three this is substituted this notation is only changed here it is sigma there it is tau is used please keep it in mind that no not a new equation here and that one more derivation is considered a nd simply rearrangement is done and then those values are substituted in the equation one after adding these two so what we do we add first these two equations and we get the equations at tau xy we with respect to the boundary conditions the x and y and then if we substitute these two in equation one we have a relation which is this that is del two del x two del two del y two sigma xx sigma yy is equals to minus of one nu del x del y del x sorry del capital x del x del capital y del y so this is a compatibil ity in the in terms of stresses so with this note which is the second approach to find out the stresses we conclude we will also find out in case of plane strain how these equations are modified and then we will try to solve a few problems in the next l ecture refer slide t ime two thousand and thirteen so the reference slide it is as usual it is a combination of the books i am sorry i cannot pinpoint for a lecture which book is followed so formulation of elasticity problem is discussed in this lecture to some extent and probably you have come across you have learned the process followed to solve a elasticity problem and with that note i thank you for attending this lecture and we will meet again in the next class to solve a few problems thank you"}

professor anup ghosh from aerospace engineering department iit kharagpur we are in the lectures of sixth week or module six in that sequence this is lecture number thirty-one and in this already we have covered to some extent how the problems to be formulated those from the unknowns fifteen15 unknowns and fifteen equations already we have come up come across so using those how to how to solve problem that is the predominant approach and importance in this lecture we will start with there are basically two types of approach in that also in solution method also so in that solution method we will see we will learn one process in this lecture series and the other process we will learn in the next lecture so with this introduction we let us start but before we start anything i prefer always to come back to the recapitulation slide refer slide time one hundred and forty-two recapitulation slide really helps us to learn what we have done so far we have covered history brief history of aircraft development of aircraft from wright brothers and then to the present days the huge al225 or a380 or and also you have learned aerospace structural analysis or solidmechanics from the starting point how physicist approached the problem how the first experiment or documented experiment done by leonardo da vinci all those things we have learned we have also said that in the recent years few years back also there are good famous theories by quieter sanders with respect to the shells shells are very good or applicable structure for aero industry aerospace structures always things are curved in most of the cases so from there we went to the various types of external loads encountered by an aircraft and then we have come across to the conceptual detail of those structures aircraft structures those conceptual details to some extent we have seen with different diagrams internals of ribs frames all those things spar we have seen how do they look like then what are the load type may be encountered while it is on ground or it is airborne why what is the concept of light envelope how the inertia row plays a huge role in case of aircraft structure how the load factors take care of that and fix a regime of design for different type of aircrafts from there we have seen how different parts of aircraft like wing landing gear tail plane tail assembly experience different type of loads fuselage experiences different type of load and from there also we have learned with typical example of shear force bending moment diagram of whole aircraft we have considered in two part one the wing as separately how the bending moment shear force is coming on it considering unit load method and then we have seen for fuselage also then three dimensional structures are important in our aircraft industry it is not only used in landing gear it that is also used in different other parts of the structure also like the tail wing or the internal fuselage construction if we look at it may be analyzed as considering a plane frame but it is probably better with invention of modern tools may be considered as three dimensional one with modern tools all structures are nowadays done with as three dimensional structures and it is analyzed unless it is very very computationally expensive or it requires huge resourceso from their introduction of loads and other things we have gone to the deflection how energy methods help us to find out deflection deflections are interesting because in any structure especially in aircraft structures deflections are interesting because deflection governs many things many things in the sense one good example is that as we have discussed earlier also then again to there is no harm in discussing again while at the position of takeoff say it is taxing in that case the aircraft wing is loaded with fuel the maximum amount of well in general whatever is possible is stored inside and because of that it bends down how much the tip bends down how much the engine comes close to the ground that becomes important so we need to find out deflection not only that because of that the aerodynamics also changes because of that say the deflection of wing changes and if the deflection of wing changes it also changes the lift if you go into more deep the aero elastic phenomena that this i have not talked about earlier that also changes because inertia is changing deflection pattern is changing many way it changes in that way up to that we have talked about more on aircraft structures but after that what we have started is that a theory of elasticity part which is the basic of solid mechanics structural analysis whatever the way we think that way and we have learned and redefined we must say we have learnt how the stress is defined and from there we have found out equations of equilibrium we have found out principal stresses shear stresses strain displacement relations compatibility equations have redefined strain and then we have come across about fifteen unknowns what we were talking about few minutes back and with that concept let us try to see how do we solve problems refer slide time 0817so in this we will be mainly concentrating on the inverse method of solution and let us see how do we do that refer slide time eight hundred and thirty but before that some part was truncated in the last lecture we have done in the last lecture the compatibility equation in terms of stress for solution what we generally satisfy to solve problem instead of satisfying the displacements in terms of strain we generally try to do in terms of strain and that is the approach we try to do because stress it is easier so in that context we have already learned that for plane stress condition how the compatibility equation in terms of stress gets modifiedso we have so grad square sigma x sigma y and the right hand side x and y are the surface forces acting for unit area and this is one one nu but same way this is for plane stress condition that means what we have done is that sigma zz tau in this case all these are equals to zero so considering that we have got this equation now if we try to find out similar one while we do for the go for the plane strain so let us see how do we do in plane strain already it is it is described many times that it is described many times that it is similar to the stress but only the third direction component of strain is restrained it is considered as zero so compatibility condition we need to satisfy in terms of stress that is the reason compatibility is written first at the beginning now what we can do the previous method if you not all the steps are repeated here but it is easy you can easily do it this strain components are put considering these values for the strain expressions are put back to this equation so we get the equations in terms of stress once we get the equations in terms of stress then a little bit modification of the equilibrium equation with respect to the surface forces we can easily do and we can find out the equation what is listed here as the plane strain condition so i repeat what is done this epsa z is equals to zero epsa xx epsilon yy and epsa zz all these terms are put back in this equations and then what do we do is we do a little bit modification of the equation and go for two and we find out the equations for compatibility in terms of stress in planes in plane strain condition one point you must note that here that the left hand side this is same even this part is also same only this constant is changing so with that note let us move forward refer slide time 1223so we here it comes the stress function concept as we have already introduced that instead of compatibility in terms of displacement or strain we are coming to the stress function or in terms of stress we try to solve in terms of stress so in that process what we will do this function facilitates the solution of elasticity problem but the function is how the function is what are the things to satisfy that let us see so in that case for a 2d problem stresses are related to single function of xy such that substitutions of these stresses in terms of this function automatically satisfy the equation of equilibrium no matter what form of function may take however an appropriate stress function must satisfy the 2d equations of compatibility plus appropriate boundary condition so this has to be done and if we have seen that instead of the boundary instead of the forces surface forces capital x and capital y the compatibility equations in terms of stress what we have seen reduces to this or we can say that the compatibility condition in terms of stress is this one and we also have in for a 2d case equilibrium equation without a body force is this when we do not have any force like that so considering that what we can go forward that here comes whatever conditions we have said here about the function that function is denoted by phi we say that we need to define such a way that that sigma x here again a small mistake is there typographical mistake definitely this is equals to sigma xx equals to del two phi del y square sigma yy or sigma y is equals to del two phi del x square and tau xy is equals to delta phi del x del yso if we see we also define or bring one more persons name famous physicist name that is airy airy\u2019s stress function phi is known as where phi is airy test stress function substituting in one in this satisfies the equilibrium equation so this can directly be substituted here and this we say that this takes the form of bi harmonic equation grad four phi is equals to zero so if this z is satisfied we say that the equilibrium condition is satisfied so with this note and concept of phi we need to consider a phi i should not say imagine we need to consider we need to need to find out a function phi which represents the stress for a particular problem and in that particular problem the stresses components in two dimensional is sigma xx axis this sigma yy is this and tau xy is this so with that concept let us move forward to solve problems refer slide time one thousand, six hundred and thirty-eight here comes the two ways of solving problem inverse and semi inverse method as it is mentioned we will first learn the inverse method and in the next lecture we will go through the semi inverse method so to go through the methods in brief the task of finding a stress function satisfying the above condition is quite difficult as just now i was telling you i was hesitating to define so you just may think of how difficult it is to find out to formulate the phi so that it represents a particular stressed body with its stressesso it is really difficult it needs lot of experience it needs maybe while they did all these things probably they did a lot of experiments and then from the experiments they try to do all these things to find out the stresses so with this note let us go forward and alternate approach is known as the inverse method here we specify a form of phi satisfying equation three what is equation three this is equation three ok so that is the equilibrium equation to satisfy it and then what we can do is that assume an arbitrary boundary and then determine the loading condition which fits the assumed stress function and choose boundary so this is the reason it is said inverse so we are finding out the first stresses and boundaries conditions and then we are put saying that it is applicable for this type of case usually phi is expressed as polynomial that is the good way of doing it because the nature if you look at of grad four phi it is better to follow a polynomial you may use other things say whatever the experience you have you may try and share with us so first let us consider as an example one in the inverse method let us consider that phi is equals to ax square b xy cy square so where a b and c are constant it satisfies that grad four phi so that means the fourth derivative of x if we consider this is definitely goes to zero that is y definitely will go partial derivative we will see and the second two consecutive second partial derivative the second term if we talk about that if we consider for this that also is zero here also it becomes zero here also it becomes zero and the third one which is third part of the grad four that is the partial derivative with respect to y in four order that also makes it zero so it is satisfied once it is satisfied the stresses are stresses are listed here it is double derivative so we have 2c it is also double derivative with respect to x we have 2a and this tau del two phi del x del y that leads to \u2013b now let us try to see the let us try to draw what is the condition we are getting if we if we represent all this in this particular element sigma x is 2c on this side as well as it is 2c in this side and acting uniformly in the element in the x direction y is also 2a acting in the y direction sigma yy and we have a shear stress where it is of b that is the reason the sign is shown in the opposite direction and with this notation we say that it represents a good plane stress conditionand this plane stress conditions we may use for solution of any problem the derived stress conditions are shown below representing the state of stress described by the assumption of stress function so this is what this assumption describes this problem so this is inverse method let us see one or two more problems in the inverse approach refer slide time two thousand, one hundred and forty-six so in this approach what we see is that example two we again assume one polynomial in this case the polynomial what we have assumed is is ax cube by six bx square y by two cx by square by two and dy cube by six so this also satisfies this by harmonic equation or grad four phi is equals to zero that you can easily check i would suggest you check i have not worked out these things here verbally i have described in the last but it is you may do try this so similar following the similar approach since this is the first part of assumption we can find out the stresses what do we have in the stresses that the sigma x is equals to cx dy cx dy right and the sigma y is similar function is very very symmetric one so definitely it is ax by the sigma y and tau xy what do we have we have as bx \u2013 cy now this gives us a certain type of stress conditionsbut probably that does not represents a problem what we are looking for so let us see if we consider these constants a b c d in such a manner or that it represents some practical problem so the first case we will see that is the problem where we are assuming here abc are completely arbitrary and a variety of loading conditions are possible on a rectangular plate if we assume abc is equals to zero that means abc is equals to zero what is happening sigma x is equals to only dy sigma y is becoming zero oh here it is written sigma x is equals to dy sigma y is equals to zero and tau xy is also equals to zero so what do we get we get a stress condition something like this d is varying if this is the element we are talking about half above half below in that case what is happening with respect to d since it is changing it is representing stress here is distension and in this part it is compression where do we get this type of problem this type of stresses we get it in pure bending pure bending means there is no change of bending in along the length of the structure as well as there is no shear force is acting so that is the reason it is it is to some extent concluded and we will be using this letter this understanding will use later that dy cube by six this term of this inverse approach shows its it this inverse approach solves or shows the bending problem now with this approach we will see this bending is as i told you this is one good example probably for pure bending a cantilever beam and at tip there is a load p if this length is l the projection length then this beam is actually under pl moment and that moment is a pure bending because there is no shear force acting in the transverse direction of the beam so the beam load in the beam is pure bending and that stress distribution in this is the only normal stress and there is axial one more addition is there p we can easily have that that is not represented here but it is similar to that there must be some additional load of the p so to nullify that we can easily put one more load here as p then that axial load is also missing but there is a bending moment so with this condition we can have a pure bending but the next portion with assumption of other variables let us see how it represents so while we assume thata c d equals to zero what do we have we have sigma x is equals to zero sigma y is equals to by and tau xy is equals to by and that particular stress condition is shown here in this stress condition if you look at the sigma y is by at any distance b this amp amplitude if we talk about this is how much then if this is b that means capital b multiplied by small b by two so this is what and the other way this side it is minus but please note that the tau is having varying with x and here also along this boundary it is varying in here there is no stress acting in this boundary so in this boundary axis value is zero and sigma y is not having any component of x so that is the reason you please note that the shear stress is varying this way here similarly it is varying this way here since it is like this so the shear stress varies like that and it is constant here at this end so with representation of a c and d equals to zero considering the inverse approach considering the stress functions the stress function as shown as the polynomial we can have this type of problem and with this introduction to the inverse method we will consider the semi inverse method in our next lecture so we have come to the end of this lecture refer slide time two thousand, nine hundred and forty-two refer slide time 2950the standard reference is shown here so please try to follow in case of problem or if you have more query about those so the inverse method we have learnt and in that consequence i would like to thank you for attending this lecture and we will move forward to learn the next lecture thank you"}
{"audio_filepath": "/media/rishu/Data1/Code Playground/test_ai4b/wav/32.wav", "duration": 1800.08, "text": "irty-two semiinverse method of solution welcome back to aircraft structures one this is a professor anup ghosh from aerospace engineering iit kharagpur we are in the lectures of 6th week or the module six in sequence this is the thirty-two lecture and this is involved with the semi inverse method of solution semi inverse method of solution in terms of theory of elasticity approach to solve problems and in that sequence we will learn how do we solve problem with a typical example refer slide time one hundred and eight now in that sequence we always in every lecture i try to cover what we have learnt so far this time i will try to cover it in more brief as quickly as i can history aircraft development from a small one at kitty hawk by wright brothers to the huge one like the an225 we have learned history of solid mechanics or structural analysis or the way you see then various types of loads encountered or experienced by aircraft structure is discussed where how those loads comes and then we have learned the inertia loads play a huge role in design and that in that context we have learned the flight envelope and flight envelope also varies with respect to a particular type of aircraft depending upon its service condition we have learned how can we find out from theoverall external load the bending moment and shear force is encountered by wing and fuselage then we have learned three dimensional structures we have solved a few problem in three dimensional structures with respect to landing gear problems and then we have started the deflections energy methods in that we have learned castiglione\u2019s method total potential energy method complementary energy method and we have learned a very very good method what i say that probably less the fundamental foundation of future numerical analysis that is the rayleigh\u2019s method to some extent in that discussion came the variation variational calculus not that way but anyway you are introduced maybe so and then the theory of elasticity got introduced to stress then equilibrium with body forces surface forces stress transformation concept of stress transformation our total discussion was predominantly in the cartesian coordinate system then from there the principle stresses how do we find a plane where there is no shear stress and from there we have discussed that what are the properties of principle stresses how invariant is observed then we have established strain displacement relation then compatibility compatibility combination how it is important without that solution is not practical we need to satisfy the compatibility condition or equations then stress strain relations we have found out then in the last class last lecture we have covered the way how a problem is formulated and then solved in that method we have already solved two three problems with respect to the inverse method in the inverse method we directly assume the stress function it is stress function and then we try to put the bound find out we try to find out the stresses components of stresses and then accordingly putting the boundary sorry putting the constants to zero or modifying the constants we can achieve some problem which represents the stress functions properly refer slide time 0516so with that note we will try to solve problems in theory of elasticity with semi inverse method it is almost similar we will use some conclusions like the pure bending portion what we have learned in the semi inverse method part of the equation that we will be using to solve this particular a particular example refer slide time five hundred and forty-one so before we go for the solution of the particular example let us get introduced to the method so in this process what we do so disadvantage of inverse method we are determining problems to fit and assume solution whereas in structural analysis the reverse is the case so that is quite obvious but the solution may be simplified by looking at the shape of the boundary and the applied loading semi inverse method is popular in that sense it is suggested by saint venantsemi inverse method is suggested by st venant here assumptions are made to stress or displacement components but before we go since the same benefits st venant principle is better to come across once this is important this lines are important you please i will read i will try to explain with one example in the next slide i will try to explain i will tell you very very simplified words also that would not include all these but those are not totally correct simplification always sacrifices something anyway if a system of forces acting on a small portion of a surface of an elastic body is replaced by another statically equivalent of force acting on the same portion of the surface this redistribution of loading process produces substantial changes in the stress only in the intimate neighborhood it changes substantially but in the intimate neighborhood of the loading and the stresses are essentially the same in the parts of the body which are at large distance in comparison with the linear dimension of surface on which the forces are changed linear dimension of the surface on which the forces are changed so it says that if i replace by equivalent or statically equivalent force system at the vicinity it is not the same case but at some distance it is same and that some distance is what it is that distance is governed by this linear dimension of the surface on which the forces are changed that is a principle is really very very important observation and noted by saint venant this helps us a lot in the next page we will see how it helps us but without looking into this thing we have considered this in our mind and we have solved problems already in your mechanics in your other say here also whatever we have covered from during problem solving we have assumed this so by statically equivalent systems we mean that the two distribution of forces have the same resultant force and moment so let us see the example refer slide time 0925so by static evil equivalent system we mean that the two distribution of forces have the same resultant force and moment so what is shown here that if 2p loads are applied at some section aa this is the distribution of stresses because of this two concentrated load at this point but while the section is l apart which is more than the b it is uniform that is what we you always talk about is not it we say that load is applied at the tip of the member and the stress is uniform p by a so that p by a here it is say the area is a then it is 2p by a so that is what is a venant said it in a different way it says that if it is replaced by a force system if it is replaced by many other forces summing up to p and statically equivalent then it is same at a distance l where it is more than b so both the said forces will induce similar type of stresses with this context with this understanding we will move forward to our next slide refer slide time 1102and in next slide we will solve a problem this problem is quite popular from your first day of mechanics probably problem is similar only difference is that we have assumed a different coordinate system we have drawn the problem in a different way the boundary condition or the fixed support is on the right hand side at the center of the beam we have assumed the origin and x is going this way and y is coming downward so with this consideration we will do it is h this is d so the section dimension so with this consideration let us try to find out the solution so solution means stress as well as deflection h is much less than the d the loaded beam can be regarded as an example in plane stress condition so upper and lower ages are free from load and the resulting shear forces at x equals to zero is p so there is no load on the upper and lower edge there is a shear force distributed shear force acting at this edge which results into p this is a boundary condition we will use later we can see that sigma xx at any point of the section is proportional to y bending moment at any section is proportional to x so this sigma x s is proportional to y this part already we have seen in our previous inverse method and that brings us to this c one y cube by six and then b a bending moment at any section is proportional to x that there is an x factor is coming here and that governs this lines observation to our physical condition gives us the way that this part is something like thisso with this note what we can do we can start let us assume for a trial sigma xx is equals to c one xy where c one is constant so this is same c one small or capital we are following this i jumped here to give you that observation but it can have from this type of approach also where following this y and x multiplication also we can assume and then if we integrate that what do we have we get the same term what we have there and we also have two functions f one x multiplied by y and f two x without any multiplication as two functions of x because we are integrating the partial differentiation equation with respect to y where f one x and f two x are known as functions of x now the compatibility it is satisfied there is no doubt but to satisfy this what we get we get one more relation in terms of f one and f two so while we do this if we carry out this term by term i can again explain like the way i have explained earlier but better you try once so with application or to satisfy the compatibility condition what we have is that y del four f one del x four del four f two d it is a complete derivative because these are only a function of x so with that note we move forward refer slide time one thousand, five hundred and forty-two since f one f two are functions of x only since f one and f two are functions of x only the second term in the above equation is independent of y but this must be satisfied for all x and y in the beam this is possible only if this is equals to zero this stating this is very easy but it requires a lot of a lot of understanding or on the mathematical equations if you think deep you will also come to thesame conclusion that this individually these two functions must be zero to be satisfied by the grad four phi equation now if we integrate all these terms f one is equals to what we have is that c two c three c four c five and f two is equals to six seven eight nine it is changing the power i hope it there is no point of explaining it so the phi changes with the constants starting from c one to c nine nine constants yes we have to find out and to find out those constants let us see what do we do we need to put the boundary conditions but with these constants in place we can find out the expressions for sigma yy and tau xy so those expressions are quite obvious as it is shown here and we try to put the boundary condition this boundary condition is interesting sigma y is zero at y equals to d by two for all x if we go back to the previous equation previous figure we can easily observe that at this and at this which are d by two definitely it is stress free and that is the reason we say that this boundary condition holds so with this node we move forward refer slide time one thousand, eight hundred and nine so the boundary condition as it is said in the last page is repeated here and we apply the boundary condition once we apply the boundary condition to sig ma yy we have see very very interesting one again minus minus minus minus otherwise it is same and again either i need to mathematically prove or i can simply assume that it holds and we can proceed these equationsmust be valid for all x between zero to l x for zero to l only when this constants are equals to zero thats why it is made to zero this so both the equations should hold only in case while these are individually equals to zero these are proved in maths we would not spend time for that and consequently these four conditions this is for this particular nature of the boundary conditions implementation equations we get that c two c three c four c seven are equals to zero and then tau xy is equals to we have minus of c one by two y square minus c four we have one more boundary condition that is tau xy on y equals to d by two is also equals to zero that is it is also shear stress free it is not only the normal stress free the boundary are top and bottom there is no shear stress also this is a small correction this is definitely not too equal signs this is equals to zero so with that note what we see is that this gives us a relation between c one and c four and as i mentioned at the beginning while we were defining the problem that distributed shears stresses at x equals to zero that means if we go back at this point upper and lower edges are free from load and the resulting shear force at x equals to zero is p so that is what we will implement now this is implemented here and if we implement that h is multiplied with to make it force so we with simple integration substitution of the tau xy whatever we have this value and other things and it yields that c one is equals to minus of twelve p by d cube h and same since i is already is quite well known equals to minus p by i and at the end all the nine constants are known once we have all the nine constants known we can have expressions for sigma x as well as sigma y and tau xy so the tau xy reduces to the expressions are something like this as we have if after implementation of the constants sigma xx is equals to minus p xy by i sigma yy is definitely zero everywhere and tau xy is equals dependent on the y square and accordingly we have refer slide time 2227so in the next portion we will try to solve the displacements displacements equations are interesting to solve it is simple mathematics now there is no one not much of elasticity or structures only boundary conditions are there boundary conditions in terms of mathematics you need to understand and you need to implement so keeping in mind what we have the strain expression we put from the stress what we have we integrate similarly for epsa y we have this expression and gamma xy we have this expression we name this as this one two three if we integrate there will be unknowns definitely so we get g one y g two x so with that and definitely gamma also will be there so we can so we have found out by integration the del u and v here what we see that since it is a partial derivation of x so integration gives us a function of y and g2 gives us a function of x and similarly we will be using this expression so incidentally one thing is one typographical mistake is noticed you please note that this is not multiplication this is i should do it with red ink blue is not visible this is a positives plus sign so with this note please i think it is you can also easily put it and in the next slide while we will move we will use this equations we will substitute these values there in the again these values in the third equations and we will proceed further refer slide time 2431so we go to the next equation so substituting in three equation three what do we have and little bit rearrangement definitely we have that is the reason we have partial derivative with respect to y and we have also the other term with respect to x and it is rearranged a little bit i hope you can easily carry it out and then the left hand side is a this rearrangement is done to with keeping in mind with the things that all the y terms are kept on the left hand side and the wall x terms are kept on the right hand side so the left hand side is a function of y and right hand side is a function of x a function of x can be equal to a function of y for all values of x and y only when they are both equal to constant that is quite obvious this phenomena will be using in many part while you will go for the higher stages of say any course say it is if it is cfd or dynamics structural learning\u2019s or anywhere so anyway this is a mathematical phenomena and according to that we assume that it is a constant a ok so we put this is equals to a one and that is the other side also is also equals to a two and again we rearrange once we rearrange and integrate we get g1 and g2 we have two more constants because of integration that is a two and a three so all total we have three unknowns again fine so we need to find out those three unknowns how can we find out those three unknowns we have we are in the process of finding displacement all functions are in terms of u vso we need to put boundary condition in terms of u and v so while we put in terms of that u v the boundary condition refer slide time two thousand, six hundred and forty-four what we can see let us see so then we the displacements are u v as it is put as y a one a two a one a three all the constants uv is completely written here and the boundary conditions at x equals to l and y equals to zero that means at this point as well at this point the other x equals to l sorry not at this point at this point x equals to l y equals to zero here uv u equals to v equals to del v del x that means the slope is also zero because the structure is supposed to bend like this this slope is always zero these are zero so with that implementation of three boundary conditions easily we can find out a one a two and a three and if we solve those what do we get is that a one is equals to pl square by two i z i one nu p d square by four e i a two is equals to zero and a three equals to pl cube by thrice ei and if we substitute those values a two is zero so this is a y function is there and we just put it here and in a different way and we also put the v boundary condition and the deflection curve for the neutral axis since it is neutral axis which parameter goes to zero that is y equals to zero so v expression y equals to put to zero and we have this expression only so this is the equation of the deflection line this is the line we are talking about so this is equation of this line ok and one more interesting point probably you have solved using various methods that the tip deflection is always pl cube by three eiso that if you put x equals to zero this goes off this is also equals to zero and we have the desired solution is equals to pl cube by three ei so with this note the preliminary discussion of theory of elasticity ends and in next two weeks we will solve specific problems with help of theory of elasticity we will see how it is important how does it gives insight to a certain problem and accordingly we will learn a lot so we have come to the end of todays lecture refer slide time three thousand and six refer slide time three thousand and nine in this process the usual the reference slide comes and also comes the conclusion page where we have learnt that semi inverse method of solution using one example of cantilever beam and with that note i thank you all for attending the course thank you"}

structures one course this is professor anup ghosh from aerospace engineering iit kharagpu r we are at the beginning of the module seven or the 7th week lectures we will be discussing equilibrium equation in polar coordinate system because the type of problem what we will attempt this week is requires the polar coordinate system polar coordinate system i want to mean not in general the coordinate system will be our highlight of discussion our main aim will be to discuss the discuss and develop the equilibrium equations compatibility equations and other theory of elasticity equations what we have already learned with respect to cartesian coordinate system so those cartesian coordinate system expressions we need to convert in polar coordinate system and in this particular case it is not exactly polar coor dinate system what we will be using we will be using a similar to a cylindrical coordinate system so the difference between polar coordinate system and cylindrical coordinate system may be imagined something like that the polar coordinate system describe s with angle and radius a position of a point in a globe or in a circular manner or in a spherical manner whereas in case of cylindrical system what we can imagine that it is it is a cylindrical body which is being described by the system the other way i n mathematical sense what do we say that it has a an axis of symmetry so for things which are having axis of symmetry generally we consider the cylindrical coordinate system and accordingly we go forward so we will come to the equilibrium equation deriva tion in this small lecture step by step we will learn how it is done refer slide t ime zero two hundred and fifty-four and before that as usual we let us come back to the slides of recapitulation it is important slide in the sense what we have covered so far in the lecture ser ies or lectures whatever we have um so far described so history of aircraft and aerospace structures analysis is the first topic what we have discussed in that we have learned that famous physicist have contributed a lot while we discussed about the stru ctural analysis they have discussed how what is the material a material behaves how a material behaves how many constants do we need to describe a material behavior there was so many confusions initially and then finally there was a consensus that for i sotropic material again if we talk isotropic what is isotropic that is also a matter of question so they defined discussed isotropic they defined that e and u are the two constants which are sufficient to describe linear elastic material again i use the word linear linear elastic so they also have discussed linear elasticity non linear elasticity all those things and slowly they have developed they have proposed analysis theories not only static analysis theories they have proposed discussed analysis th eories related to dynamics also or say the time dependent load and time dependent load how structures behave and then and then we got defined that what is structures how anything bears a load and then we have come across that may be there are some speci fic structures which are predominantly used like plates and cells and we have also seen that the cell structures development have taken place in the last few years back the basic fundamental developments have been done by scientist physicist researchers i n maybe in last fifty years also so with that we have looked into the history of aircraft also development of aircraft starting from the kitty hawk by wright brothers and then we have come across more than one hundred years almost one hundred and twenty little less than one hundred and twenty years an d we have crossed huge steps starting from monocoque to semi monocoque structures and from structures point of view from isotropic material used to the orthotropic material use from material use of metal to plastic like that we have learned the other deve lopments mainly we have put our stress in terms of structural analysis then various types of external loads conceptual structural details we have learned so because and structure a structure is supposed to withstand loads so where from loads come into that structure or on an aircraft so that is important so we have discussed various situations various flight regimes maneuvers during which portion gets stressed more which portion is designed in a overall manner we have discussed that we have seen that there are specific groups who takes care of all these design part it is not that somebody is sitting on a desk and designing an whole aircraft there are experts who finds out the type of loads and the y estimates those there is a an agency known as airwor thiness agency in every country almost it is there so they looks at the critical conditions from where the maximum load is encountered by an aircraft so according to that some schedule procedures have already been laid out and people follow that enginee rs designers follow that and those various types of loads we have discussed to some extent in overall manner we have seen how the structures are fabricated from thin wall members from forming using the process of forming how thin wall thin plates thin she ets are bend according to the required section type and then those are used how those rivets are done all those things we have just discussed articulated portions of wing fuselage we have seen we have not analyzed those parts are may be done in detail i n some other course then other things like flight envelope we have seen load factors we have seen many many more things shear force bending moment diagrams all those things on fuselage and wing we have seen we have seen energy methods for deflection we have seen approximate methods we have seen studied theory of elasticity cartesian coordinate approach we have solved problems we have seen that there are fifteen unknowns we need fifteen equations considering equilibrium stress strain and strain displacements and then what we have come across today is that formulation of a problem which requires some other coordinate system we have solved problems also in last lecture and previous to that refer slide t ime zero nine hundred and forty-eight and today we will go into the formulation or sa y derivation of the equilibrium equation in polar coordinate system so let us start with that refer slide t ime zero nine hundred and fifty-seven so in that what we will do the general equations in polar coordinate system we need to find out the first equations what we will att empt today is the equilibrium equation before we go into the equilibrium equation it is to better to describe what is there on the right hand figure this figure what do we consider and how do we do that is described here also in a very concise manner what we are considering that again as i told you we are considering asymmetric portion say there is some structure which is asymmetric about the z axis z axis is not shown which is from this point towards me or on the other side so if it is if we follow t he right hand coordinate system it is going from me to the board that means it is coming this way and it is going the other way to the board so it is something like this x is coming to y and z is coming down so anyway that part the axis of the symmetry w e wo uld not discuss here but we will discuss here that we are considering a small element given by this one two three four and named as p p is the center point of that element and what do we see that there are two the radius of point p is as it is said op is equals to r up to this point it is r and we see that there are two red other radial components which are d theta by two apart from the theta or on the other sense we can say that from this point it is d theta apart two radial planes which are perpendicular to xy plane is cutting the element and two cylindrical plane say from this point to this point these points to this point are cutting this element so this element is having two straight edges two curved edges given as name one two three four and this element is theta at theta degr ee angle with respect to the x now we have we need to find out the equilibrium of that particular element to find out the equilibrium of that particular element we have given three components of stresses here those components are sigma r sigma theta and tau r theta ok so it is to better to define what is r what is sigma r and what is sigma theta sigma r is for this part particular element or in this coordinate system we are describing the stress experienced in the radial direction so that is the reason r i s given here and theta theta is perpendicular to any particular radial line or plane ok this is perpendicular to this plane given a notation sigma theta so perpendicular to this plane acting outward as tension considering positive is given as sigma theta and as usual there are complementary shear stresses obscure stresses come always in pair so those are given here tau r theta tau r theta tau r theta tau r theta and with respect to the plane the name subscripts and brackets are introduced as one two three four and these are also given one two three four considering the plane where it is acting so let us see what is written here and read almost the same thing is described here in a very concise manner let us see in discussion stresses in plates with circular holes circular rings and discs card bars of narrow rectangular cross section with a circular axis etcetera it is advantageous to use polar coordinate so why do we need polar coordinate that is what is said it is advantageous to discuss it in polar coordinate while ther e is a problem of a circular hole in a plate circular rings or discs curved bars or narrow rectangular cross sections bars of narrow rectangular cross sections with a circular axis in those cases if we consider if we discuss with this type of coordinate system it becomes helpful the position of the point in the middle plane of a plate is then defined by the distance from the origin and by the angle theta between r and a certain axis ox fixed in the plane let us now consider the equilibrium of the smal l element one two three four cut out from the plate by the radial section o four o four o two o two it is something like a plane acting on this normal to the plate that is the reason it is saying normal to the plate it is difficult to so it is acting like this and by two cylind rical surfaces three one normal to the plate refer slide time one thousand, six hundred and twenty-six so it is the same figure we need to refer this figure for repeated leaf or derivation so the normal stress components in the radial direction is denoted by sigma r the normal component in the circumferential direction is given by sigma theta and the shearing stress component tau r theta each symbol representing stresses at that point r and theta this is the point r theta which is the point p of the element point p of the element on acco unt of variation of stress the values at midpoint of side s one two three four are not quite the same as the value of sigma or sigma theta r theta and are denoted by sigma r one r two r three like that so it is said that since there is we are considering that there is a vari ation so if that is the reason these are components are given some other subscripts the radii of the sides three and three one are denoted by r three and r one the radial forces on the side one is sigma r one r one d theta sigma r one d theta is this area d theta multiplied by this we are considering unit width in the z direction that is the reason it is not coming so this length is r one d theta multiplied by sigma r one so that is the force considering unit width unit depth z direction it is the force may be written as sigma r r one d theta and similar to the radial similarly the radial force on side three is minus is given because it is acting in the opposite direction that can also be got considering this and we get this equation so these two components of forces we have now let us see the other components refer slide time one eight hundred and forty-three the normal force on side two has a component along the radius through p of sigma theta two r one r one minus r two sine d theta by two so if this is d theta by two it is very very thin line so this component is as it is given here as sigma theta two r one r two sine d theta by two so it is acting in this direction that is there is in the minus is coming here and sin d theta by two is very small angle that is the reason we can directly consider that it is equals to d thet a by two that is what is said and this change of length that radius is considered as dr so this becomes minus sigma theta two dr d theta by two similarly from this also we will have one more component if i draw it will become little bit clumsy so we can easily imagine that one more component will come say that is also coming in this direction so similar way that one is this is also d theta by two and accordingly we get this value now the shearing forces on side two and four gives side two and four this is side two and this is side four considering two this side positive this minus this dr is the total force considering again z unit depth summing up forces in the radial direction including body force r per unit volume in the radial direction we obtain that this is coming here as si gma r one sigma r not this one this is described in the previous slide this component this component is this component this is this component as it is given this is this component as it is given and this cr portion here whatever is given and this is the body f orce so we have in the radial direction this is the equation and we see how this equation changes refer slide time two thousand, three hundred and thirteen so in this what we have we divide the previous equation with dr and d theta and what do we have is that sigma r r one sigma r three by dr half sigma theta two sigma theta four tau r theta two tau r theta four by d theta are smaller equals to zero so if the dimensions of the elements are now taken smaller and smaller to the limit zero this is nothing but considering the limit the first term of t he equation is in the limit of del sigma r r dr this gives del sigma r dr the second becomes sigma theta it is average of two sides and the third this als o becomes del tau r theta del theta now if it is a multiplication of two terms if we expand this using d el du v del x that multiplication of two variables derivation concept if you use the equation of the equilibrium in the tangential direction may be derived in the what do we get is this equation sorry this is for this statement so what do we get is this eq uations from this component we get this as well as we get this component sigma r by r and the remaining is whatever we have this is this component r is getting divided this is this component so all the components after getting it in the radial direction w e have this equilibrium equation and the process what is shown already considering those process if we consider in this direction the equilibrium and in that direction equilibrium whatever we can get is the equation the equation of equilibrium in the tange ntial direction may be derived in the same manner the two equations take the final form as one by r del sigma theta d theta del theta del tau r theta del r two tau r theta by r equals to zero so we get the equilibrium equations considering the body forces in case of polar coordinate system or particular case the cylindrical application or cylindrical coordinate system because we are not considering the z considering as a symmetric portion of that refer slide time two thousand, six hundred and six so with that we proceed further th e equations are the equations of equilibrium to solve two dimensional problems by means of polar coordinates when the body force r is zero they are satisfied by putting this expression with respect to phi the stress function the stress function already you hav e you are introduced to so this how do we get this expression we will prove in the next lecture but let us consider that if we transfer the stress function expression we get this stress function expressions and if we put this stress function expression in the previous equilibrium equation we those are satisfied so with respect to that we define that sigma r is equals to one by r del phi del r one by r square delta phi del theta two sigma theta is del two phi del r two and tau r theta is one by r square del phi del theta one by r del two phi del r del theta equals to minus of del del r of one by r del phi del theta this is the popular way generally written where phi is the stress function as a function of r and theta this of course may be verified by direct substituti on to yield a possible stress distribution this function must ensure that the condition of compatibility is satisfied the cartesian coordinates in cartesian coordinate this condition is as we have already seen grad four phi is equals to zero or by harmonic equ ation is this so this is our next task in the lecture forthcoming lecture we will come across about finding out the equivalent expression in polar coordinate for the compatibility equation refer slide time two thousand, eight hundred and twenty-four refer slide time two thousand, eight hundred and twenty-six so with this note we come to the almost end of that lecture and what we have learned in this slide is equilibrium equations in polar coordinate system we have derived we have derived the polar coordinate system equations for a axis symmetric case and we will fur ther find out the solution or compatibility condition with this topic we come to the conclusion concluding slide today and thank you for attending this lecture we will come back again with the compatibility equation thank you"}

structures one this is professor anup gh osh f rom aerospace engineering department iit kharagpur we are in the middle of the 7th week lectures or the module seven in sequence it this is thirty-four lecture s in the last class we have learned in polar coordinate system the equilibrium equation in this lecture we will be covering the compatibility condition in polar coordinate system and we will discuss a little bit of transformation of those stress function expressions first in terms of to find out stresses refer slide t ime zero one hundred and fourteen so with that note let us co me to the recapitulation slide among the recapitulation slide in the last lecture we have we have recapitulated history of aircraft various types of external loads in detail flight envelope to some extent we have detail we have recapitulated flight envelo pe let us starts with that again flight envelope flight envelope is the envelope within which a particular type of aircraft is supposed to maintain its flight and flight envelope is important for structures or design because whenever it flies it experie nces inertia loads more than 1g more than acceleration involved 1g so since it is very useful by any aircraft to crush twenty-five or something about come to about 3g forces so it is better to maintain a an envelope or prescribe an envelop within which the design should persist or should remain so keeping in mind those parameters what we have discussed is that flight envelope and the load factor load factor is how many times of g forces g means the gravitation force of earth is encountered by any structure tha t we need to discuss and we have seen in which condition which load factor becomes more and in this correlation we have discussed problems related to bending moment and shear force diagram of overall wing and fuselage we have come across the unit load me thod unit load method is nothing but considering unit g not only sometimes unit g sometimes unit force is also considered so that any multiplication of force or any multiplication of g factor can easily give us the desired forces or bending moment and sh ear force encountered by wing and fuselage so but it is important to analyze bending moment and shear force of wing and fuselage that is the reason we have learned about those wing wing and phase large bending moment and shear force diagram we have lear ned three dimensional structures three dimensional structures are space structures are important in terms of aircraft structures there are many applications one of the most prominent application is landing gear and in case of landing gear we use in general the truss concept or axially loaded member concept so considering a landing gear as three dimensional truss what are the deflection and what are the loads coming to the components of a truss we have solved we have solved specific problems we have seen ho w it is solved and done we are also introduced to some extent components of trusses like the oleostart member or torsion links so after that we have gone to the displacements or energy methods energy methods and displacements where it is mentioned energ y methods involving complementary energy method involving castiglione\u2019s theorem involving unit load method dummy load method so unit load method dummy load method castiglione\u2019s theorem are how those are similar to each other and how efficiently we can use to solve problems how can we even solve indeterminate problems using those methods that we have seen not only that we are introduced to a fundamental process of approximate analysis based on energy principles that is the rayleigh method we got introduc ed how approximation is considered there and how approximate good it is depending on the initial assumptions of the displacement profile that we have seen with examples and after that we have come across to the stresses or theory of elasticity approach theory of elasticity approach is important in the sense because we specifically encounter different types of types of problems which leads to fatal accident one of the important thing is stress concentration around the whole that we are in the process of dis cussion and we can see from internet that there was an aircraft designed with almost rectangular windows and that rectangular window led to catastrophic failure of the fuselage so we need to see why those are important to study so unless we learn the theory of elasticity approach unless we look into the in depth about the behavior of stress development and strain development and displacement it is difficult to predict problems so we that i s keeping in mind those things not only those things we need the fundamental development of any numerical method what we are popular like the finite element method is based on this elasticity theory of elasticity and energy methods so unless we learn all these methods very very efficient way we will not be able to learn the further topics that is the reason theory of elasticity is introduced and in last two weeks we have we have considered cartesian coordinate system we have found out stresses equilibrium equations principle structures shear stresses stress strai n strain displacement relation compatibility strain stress strain relations all those and the last lecture we got introduced to the polar coordinate system for theory of elasticity because we our aim in this week is to discuss the stress distribution aroun d a hole due to a simple tension in a plate refer slide t ime zero nine hundred and seven so in following that line what we will do we will learn in this lecture the compatibility condition in polar coordinate refer slide t ime zero nine hundred and eleven this is again a kind of simple m athematical derivation it there you do not have much concept of elasticity or structures its simple mathematical approach let us see how it is done so to yield a possible stress distribution stress function phi must ensure that the condition of compatibi lity is satisfied this is the condition of compatibility in cartesian coordinates this condition is as stated here and sometimes we write this as grad four phi is equals to zero so with this we proceed further for present purpose we need this equation to be tr ansferred to polar coordinates the relation between polar and cartesian coordinate is given by r square equals to x square y square its quite obvious and theta is equals to tan inverse y by x or r tan y by x this is quite a i think you can easily do it it is not big issue this is r so that is the way it is done for which we have del r del x just simple from this what we have is x by r and if we that is equals to cos theta del r del y is equals to sin theta now del theta del x if we use this one we have minus y by r square and that can easily be stated as sin theta by r and similar way del theta i think a minus is missing here so please put that del theta del y is equals to x by r square cos theta by r using this and considering phi as a function of r an d theta we find that it is del t phi del x is equals to simple series way it is done del phi del r multiplied by del r del x similarly del phi del theta multiplied by del theta del x and then we substitute these values we have del phi del r cos theta del phi one by r del phi del theta sin theta so minus is because of this it is missing here please note that so with that we move forward to the next slide refer slide t ime one thousand, two hundred and twenty-one in this slide what we have to get the second derivative with respect to x it is only necessary to repeat i think i need to clean more to get the second derivative with respect to x it is only necessary to repeat the above operation hence del two phi del x square is nothing but multiplication of those two here please note in mat hematical way how it is written and if we carry out that multiplication we have how many terms one two three four five terms and those five terms are because of this rr is involved here those and other terms will come and we need to simplify those things i would suggest y ou carry out that so it is finally we get del two phi del r square cos square theta two del two phi del theta del r sin theta cos theta by r del phi del r sin square theta by r two del phi del theta sin theta cos theta by r del two phi del theta square sin sq uare theta r square so these are the similar term and the similar way if we if we find out del two phi del y square we get a similar expression with five terms but please note that this term and this term is simply opposite in sign this term and this ter m are also opposite in sign these two if it is added will man is the theta component similarly this two if we add will vanish this theta component sin square theta plus cos square theta is becoming equals to one it is similar to these two terminals these t wo term this two term so finally what we have we have this one by r this and one by r square refer slide t ime one thousand, four hundred and forty-seven those three terms as it is mentioned we have grad square phi but we need the 4th one knows by harmonic equation we need so to in that sens e using the identity it is nothing but this is equals to this multiplied by this where this is the derivative multiplication the way it is written and it is not carried out it is better not to carried out at this position because if we carry it out it bec omes lengthy it becomes difficult to handle and we probably do not need that way that is the reason it is not carried out and simple way this term is written here as the bionic form in polar coordinate system and above second order expression the compati bility equation in polar coordinate system becomes this this is here and the other as parameter form it is written from various solutions of this partial differential equation we obtain solutions of two dimensional problems in polar coordinates for vario us boundary conditions so equilibrium equations and compatibility equation in terms of stresses compatibility equations in terms of stresses or stress function is evaluated so we need with using this we can attempt to solve problems and in this week we will try to solve problem with respect to a problem which is a whole circular hole in a plate we will see that problem how the problem simplified way we can discuss in this slide to some extent a plate if we consider this way and if it is under uniform s tress is and if we consider one circular hole at the middle what is the distribution of stress at this point what is the distribution of stress at this point whether those points are having same amount of stress experienced or not that is a very interestin g point interesting problem to discuss so with that note we will move to the next slide where we will again find out the stress function quantity in a different form in a different way refer slide t ime one thousand, seven hundred and forty-two so the second the first and second of th e above stress expressions as derivatives of stress function may be found out now because already now we have the coordinates transformation equations from cartesian to the polar we have so we can easily check those if we choose any point in the plate an d let the x axis passes through it we have theta is equals to zero and sigma x and sigma y are the same for this particular point as sigma r and sigma theta it is also similar thus for the second order partial derivative of phi with respect to y and putting theta equals to zero we can have an expression of sigma r and sigma theta and that is what is done here sigma r is equals to sigma x at theta equals to zero so that is was del two phi del y square what is we have learnt in ins area stress function definition if you remember but this transformation was not done earlier in the last lecture that is the reason it was not given we simply stated this so this equation what we can do now we are putting using this value and putting that theta is equals to zero so if we pu t theta equals to zero what will happen this is zero this is zero this is zero but this is one this is one right so we will have only these two components that is what one by r del phi del r and one by r square del two phi del theta two is present here similarly this x expres sion continues to represent sigma r whatever the orientation of x axis we find similarly from the second order partial derivative of phi with respect to x and putting theta equals to zero the expression for sigma theta and in that expression its similar way theta if we put it its similar way what we get is that this this expression only because all other terms are involving sin sin means it is leading to zero so we have finally this so with this small derivation note we will proceed further and if we follow s imilar approach we can have the expression for tau r theta tau r theta is this as it is written here we can easily find out refer slide t ime two thousand and thirty-nine so with as i said with this note of derivation we come to the end of todays lecture this is the standa rd slide of reference refer slide t ime two thousand and forty-five conclusion is that we have learned compatibility condition in polar coordinate system and we will learn further polar coordinate to consider problems in the sense of finding out stress distribution around a hole and with that node we come to the end of todays lecture next lecture we will start the problem of a circular hole in a plate which is under uniform tension thank you"}

uniform tension and to analyze this what we have done so far is that in the last two lectures we have derived equations of equilibrium as well as compatibili ty in terms of stresses in polar coordinate system we have also derived or expressed or changed the coordinate from cartesian to polar in case of stress components like sigma theta sigma r or tau r theta now we will be using those to find out the stress distribution due to a hole in a plate while the plate is under uniform tension we will consider initially only the tension maybe later in some lecture we will cover about other cases or critical cases that we will discuss refer slide t ime zero two hundred and nineteen but with this idea let us start but before we go into today \u2019s topic it is time to recapitulate or to remember back the things what we have already covered in this relation we have covered the theory of elasticity or solid mechanics history we have also see n development of aircraft starting from wright brothers kitty hawk flight then we have seen various types of external load loads conceptual structural details how the ribs sparse skins come in a aircraft wing we have seen how transverse frames are put in aircraft fuse lage how longr ons are also put in aircraft fuselage how the deck is put in the aircraft fuselage how it is divided in separate compartments with different structural parts we have seen landing gear also we have seen other components like ta il plane we have seen later the bending moment shear force distribution for the overall wing and fuselage then landing gear analysis we have done from structures point of view considering those as a three dimensional truss and then we have come to the t heory of elasticity before we come to the theory of elasticity we have also seen or found out deflections are important in any structure so deflections to find out deflection we have gone across different methods starting from strain energy complementary strain energy and then total potential energy then castiglione\u2019s theorem from their unit load method dummy load method and at the end very very important method that is the rayleigh method so thereafter we have come across with theory of elasticity theory of elasticity is important to learn in various ways if you go further for different understanding in depth the type of problem say we will be solving today or in this week that will give us insight in development of stresses around a whole similar way unless we learn theory of elasticity it is difficult to cover all the cases to predict critical conditions so keeping in mind those things theory of elasticity is taught so in that theory of elasticity where we need to find out fifteen unknowns like six component of stresses six component of strains and three components of displacements u vw so those say fifteen quantities what we need for structural analysis purpose has to have fifteen equations those equations we have derived we have talked about compatibility also com patibility is always important it holds a separate place in the total analysis so we have also seen conversion of strain compatibility to stress complement compatibility to biharmonic equations and through that we have come across to the point where we h ave some knowledge to analyze effect of a circular hole in a plate which is under in plane tension refer slide t ime zero six hundred and forty-seven so with that note let us proceed for today \u2019s lecture refer slide t ime zero six hundred and fifty the effect of circular holes on stress distrib ution in a in plates is interesting problem figure below this is what we idealize this is the way we idealize figure below represents a plate submitted to an uniform tension of magnitude s it is in plane tension in plane means the forces are acting at the plane of the plate and it is of s amplitude magnitude in the x direction if a small circular hole as it is shown here is made in the middle of the plate the stress distribution in the neighborhood of the hole will be changed so how is it going to change we can easily say it is going to change because there is a hole definitely it is not continuous so it is something will happen if we think the stresses something like on lines parallel lines and then because of the whole the lines will not get discontinu ous something will happen it will may disperse in some direction and do so that we are supposed to find out but we can conclude from saint venant\u2019s principle that the change is negligible at a distance which are large compared with a a is the radius of t he hole the radius of the hole so its saint venants principle already we have learned we have not gone through the proof but it can be proved in higher elasticity classes theory of elasticity classes that is not proved so with that respect we are consi dering that if it is the dimension position is more than a few times a then it remains same so with that concept so the changes whatever will be in the vicinity of the circle may be around in this region what is the change it is coming so while we consi der this is as a so let us see what are the other changes may come up and we can continue refer slide t ime zero nine hundred and thirty-two so with this we do some idealization of the problem and that problem let us see how do you idealize it is same stress stresses as is sh own here we are imagining that the dimension of the hole is twice a as it is shown and we also imagine some circle which is of diameter b sorry radius b and b is considerably large in comparison to a we name the whole points this is n this is m we also name the other diametrical point as p q we consider if any point which is at angle theta so x is acting this way y is acting in this direction so with that concept consider the portion of the plate with in a within a concentric circle of radius b large in comparison with a that is what we said this dimension b is large in comparison to a the stresses at the radius b are effectively the same as in the plate without the hole and r therefore given by this so what we are considering here with this expres sion that if there is a plate without a hole what are the stresses to be we are saying that the stresses to be the sigma r in the radial direction is half of s cos two theta component so it is something like if we consider a plane here and if we consider t his as the sigma r and if it is theta degree in angle instead of considering there if we consider here it will be easier to imagine if this is sigma r theta is the angle then we say this is equals to half of s s cos t two theta by two this you can easily g et from the two dimensional stress stress transformation what we have learned if you put the values only the sigma x you will get this value of sigma r there and the shear stress tau r theta in this particular plane the shear stress tau r theta is minus o f half sine two theta so it is said that beyond this circle whatever the circle we see the stresses are in this form sigma r and tau r theta so with that note let us proceed these forces acting around the outside of the ring having the inner and outer ra dius r equals to a and r equals to b give a stress distribution within the ring which we may regard as consisting of two parts so what is coming down now now instead of considering these stresses what we are considering that this annular ring is under th is stress distribution stress distribution so if it is under this stress distribution what we can again subdivide the problem in this way the first part the first is due to the constant component of half s this is the half s of normal forces the normal forces the stress stresses it produce can be calculated by means of symmetric stress distribution about an axis so what it says that if this is the case then if we can imagine some problem where stresses are acting in this form and this stress value is s by two then we can and if we are able to find out the distribution of stresses inside this body that is what the problem we want to solve so one part of the problem is this the stresses it produce can be calculated by means of symmetric stress division about an axis so this is symmetric about an axis means the axis perpendicular to this or the z axis the remaining part consisting of the normal forces half s cos two theta that means this and this multiplied together with the shearing stress minus half sine two theta will have to also find and will have to add it up considering linear superposition of the stresses developed by two different cases so the problem gets divided in two part s so let us see that is the way we will solve the problem in one par t we will consider this and the other part we will consider that there is a sigma r consisting of this part and everywhere there is a tau also with this formula refer slide t ime one thousand, five hundred and fifty-nine so what do we have the first part as i said the access symmetric case where axis of symmetry is z sigma r we are considering as s by two that part we will try to solve now the stress distribution symmetric about an axis if the stress distribution if the stress distribution is symmetrical with respect to the axis through o perpendicular to the xy plane the stress components do not depend on theta and are functions of r only so it is quite obvious that if it is symmetric it is not dependent on theta it becomes a function of r only so we consider that we think that if th is is the case we are talking about then whatever the stress here if it is some distance same distance apart from the center it is same here it is same at this place or at this place so it is only dependent on r not on theta for from symmetry it follows also that the shear shearing stress tau r theta must vanish since it is a symmetric force so there would be any tau r theta then only the first of the two equations of the equilibrium remains and we have these are the two equilibrium equations just to remembe r those i have put back again so since as it is says it is independent of theta this term is not there and since tau r theta is not present this equation completely vanish so the only remaining equation that to where we do not have any theta dependent te rm if we discard that part that remains this part this part and this part that is what is written here if the body force r is zero we may use the stress function phi when this function depends only on r the equations of compatibility becomes this is the o riginal equations of compatibility what in polar coordinate we have derived already but since as we have already mentioned theta dependent terms are not there it reduces back to this and phi what we have considered as a stress function if we put that it becomes the compatibility equations after this multiplication and derivation accordingly done this becomes the equations of compatibility in terms of stress or in terms of stress function refer slide t ime one thousand, nine hundred and forty-three this is an ordinary differential equati on which can be reduced to a linear differential equation with constant coefficients by introducing a new variable t such that r is equals to e to the power t in this manner the general solution of the above equation can easily be obtained this solution h as four constants of integration which must be determined from the boundary conditions by substituting it can be checked that phi is equals to this is a general solutions this requires lot of experience to find out this you need mathematics knowledge of goo d mathematical knowledge to do it we have skipped that part so we are considering that this holds this satisfies the previous bi harmonic equation in terms of polar coordinate applicable for a symmetric axis symmetric stress distribution and we have check ed people have checked scientists physicists have checked and said that holds the solution of all problems of symmetrical stress distribution and no body forces can be obtained from this this corresponding stress distributions are what we can say that s ince already we have derived the stress functions we have converted the stress functions and stress relations which are sigma r equals to one by r del phi del r one by r square del two phi del theta square sigma theta is equals to del two phi del r two so if we s ubstitute this value in this form of equations what we have we have these two components so once we have these two components these two equations what we can think of we can think of putting boundary conditions so to find out the constants a b c and d is van ished because it is not having any component with respect to r or theta so let us move to the next slide refer slide t ime two thousand, two hundred so it is repeated back those two slides those two equations and if there is no hole at the origin of the coordinates con stants a and b vanish since otherwise the stress components become infinite when r is equals to zero so if you look back here if r is becoming zero this component is definitely going to in finite and that is the reason we need to discard that part and for the c ase while we do not have any hole at the center but it is a axis symmetric crest which satisfies this equation so we hence for a plate without a hole at the origin and with no body forces only one case of stress distribution symmetrical with respect to t he axis may exist namely that when sigma r is equals to sigma theta and is equals to constant so both a b vanishes as we said if we look at it carefully then only it is equals to constant or equals to two c and the plate is in a condition of uniform tensio n or uniform comp compression in all direction in its plane so either it is in the depending on the type of stress acted upon on that particular case which is not this case but a case where we do not have any hole so in this particular case what we can see is that if there are stresses something like this in that case it is sigma r is equals to sigma theta and it is equals to some constant here it is 2c so it if it changes it accordingly we need to find out that value so with that note we would like t o come to the end of todays this lecture refer slide t ime two thousand, four hundred and thirty-six particular lecture and we will use these equations in the next lecture with boundary condition otherwise it becomes a bit discontinuous portion that is the result we have taken this wa y and we will find out the stresses in the hole so with that note we come to the end of this refer slide t ime two thousand, five hundred and two and we will proceed further in the next lecture thank you for attending this lecture"}

aircraft structures one course this is profes sor anup ghosh from aerospace engineering department iit kharagpur we are at the end lecture of module seven or the 7th week lectures and title of the lecture remains same effects of circular hole on stress distribution in a plate that is because so far wha t we have done in this series is we have evaluated the equations or derived i should say the equations of elasticity in polar coordinate system so that we can handle the problems problem we have specified and after that for uniform stress uniaxial stres s in plane stress of amplitude is we have solved the problem and in that solution we have also seen that there are different stresses at different points and those things more about those with those results we will spend some time in this lecture to have some more insight into the problem refer slide t ime zero one hundred and forty-seven so with that note we move forward and in this what we do is that we do the recapitulation in this recapitulation slide as usual we try to remember the work what we have or the portions what w e have already covered we started with the history of aircraft as well as history of solid mechanics and then we have slowly come to the various types of external loads conceptual structural details of aircraft structures tho ugh we have covered we have covered in depth the flight envelope and load factor how the flight envelope changes for different types of aircraft that also we have discussed it is important to find out the shear force bending moment experienced by wing and fuse lage so one typical exam ple in that correlation we have solved considering unit load concept considering 1g and some unit loading concept combined with unit load concept it is said so that for different g value or inertia load we can find out the bending moment and shear force we have solved learned to solve three dimensional structures especially trusses solved a few problems related to landing gear then we have come across two different energy methods predominantly to find out the deflection so in that method we have learned complementary energy method total potential energy approach unit load method dummy load method castiglione\u2019s theorem and also we have learned one very very important step in important procedure we must say that is the rayleigh ridge method and we have seen how the assumption of initial reflection profile is important to get a good solution or appropriate or close to experimental solutions are necessary so after that we have gone to the theory of elasticity portion theory of elasticity is very very im portant in the sense that unless we learn the theory of elasticity we are not able to have insight into the problems and this lecture specially is dealing that type of insight already we have discussed to some extent in the last few minutes of the last l ecture why a hole is analyzing a hole under uniform tension in a plate is important how more stresses are coming why the cracks open from a certain position and it goes further those things we have learned and a little bit more we will try to discuss in this lecture so this lecture is mainly the discussion about the ways it has been it has been implemented or precautions should be taken refer slide t ime zero five hundred and twenty-five so with that note let us proceed further with the problem what we have solved we have fo und out the stresses but we need to have a discussion on it refer slide t ime zero five hundred and thirty-two so with that note the same figure we bring let me have a re have a have a description of the problem what we have solved in this what we have solved is a plate is con sidered the prime thing is that the plate is loaded uniaxially along the axis x and the intensity of stress is s and then what we have is that there is a hole and we consider that the whole radius is comparatively small in comparison to the width or the ot her way it has been defined the diameter is less comparatively small in comparison to the width or a is small in comparison to b so we are considering that after b the stress remains uniform as if there is no hole in that condition and we have considered found out the stress for that from that part we have not done but you can easily do it simple stress transformation if you do you can find out the stresses for that and from there we found that it comprises of two part one is uniform stress of s by two and the others are non uniform in nature with it i would like to say why non uniform non uniformity is with respect to theta so other part is uniform with respect to theta so it is axis symmetric case that part we have solved first then the other part we have solved and we have combined equations for sigma theta sigma r as well as tau r theta so this is what we have got with respect to theta cos two theta cos two theta sin two theta also we have discussed that under this particular situation the stress at this particular point is thrice the stress applied to the plate this is three s and that is also tensile in nature here and as well as here m and n and at p and q this is compressive in nature so that is the usual reason why a crack opens up from this and goes further it is three times definitely that is supposed to fail in tension and that position and it is to propagate now in this that we have already discussed how do we get to some extent profile also discussed we will discuss again that profile so let us see wha t is there today to discuss for the cross section of the plate through the center of the hole and perpendicular to the x axis theta is equals to pi by two and from the previous stress equations around the whole what we can see is this equations they are h ere the value is only put for theta and we get that s by two two s square by r square plus 3a to the power four by r to the power four it is a at r equals to a it goes to 3s as we have seen so that holds tau r theta is equals to zero from here it is evident that th e effective effect of the whole is of a very localized character and as r increases or say in this line if we go further for to find out sigma theta the stress sigma theta approaches the value s very rapidly since it is 4th order and second order in ter ms of a and r ratio definitely it is supposed to be very very quickly to come to zero so that is what is said mathematically if you plot it gives this type of profile the localized character of the stress sorry the localized character of the stresses around the hole justifies the application of the solution so it is said that a means the solution whatever we have got if we try to check the solutions how far the initial assumption what we took that if b is comparatively large with respect to a it that uniform stress remains so whether that is prevailing or not that we are saying and it is said that it is a little distance apart only it becomes uniform so the localized character of the stresses around the hole justifies the application of the solution deri ved from the infinitely large plate to a plate of finite width so that finite width is b if the width of the plate is not less than four times the diameter of the whole the error of the solution in calculating sigma theta max does not exceed six so it says that if it is four times the diameter then the maximum error involved is six so it is quite clear that means what we can say that this side it is one and half diameter this side it is one and half diameter because this is one diameter so is not big if the figure is much more than that so with that concept we say that there is a stress concentration at this point at this point but it does not remain for much more length even if we consider the length approximately four times or the width here approximately four times th e diameter of the circle the error involved is approximately six so that is probably negligible so with that note we proceed further for the discussion refer slide t ime one thousand, two hundred and twenty we come across to a different type of problem in this problem what we see is that instead of putting only stress only in one direction we may have stress condition from both the directions so what can be the situation that is what we have tried to find ou having the solution for torsion sorry tension or compression in one directio n the solution for tension or compression in two perpendicular directions can be easily obtained by superposition\u2019s so it is we are assuming that linear superposition holds so if in one direction the solution we got have obtained we can easily find out the o ther direction separately and we can add it by taking the for instance tensile stresses in two perpendicular directions not this case tensile stress in two perpendicular direction s equals to s we find at the boundary of the hole a tensile stress of twice s why it is coming like that because if this is s this is also s because if we consider any one point there we have for one direction is plus 3s but for the other direction it is \u2013s so it becomes twice sorry twice s so similarly it is a symmetric condition so in all the corners whatever we have all the diametrically opposite position is having experiencing sigma theta or opening type of stress in this particular point say this point if we talk about sigma theta is acting we are talking about this sigma theta so that is what if we apply in both the direction tensile force but if we apply some other type of force which is more critical we need to discuss that is what is shown here it is a critical case by taking a tensile stress is in x direction better we rem ove this for in x direction as in the figure above or it is on the right hand side and a compressive stress of s compressive stress of s in the y direction we obtain the case of pure shear this is this is something what we asked you to solve see if in this particular case if we consider any element here which is forty-five degree angle this experiences a pure shear that means only shear stresses are acting there is no normal stress acting on that particular orientation element so in the there it is also may b e noted that this amplitude becomes s whatever the amplitude of the stress being applied on that that is the reason we call it as a pure shear the tangential stress at the boundary of the holes are so in this particular case of pure shear which may be ac hieved by tensile and compressive stresses as applied here we can have sigma theta is equals to this minus this it is as usual i do not want to go into deep into it for theta equals to pi by two and theta equals to three pi by two that is at the point n and m we are talking about this point as well as this point what we have we find that sigma theta is equals to 4s if you just simply substitute in this formula and see that in that particular portion we have tensile stress of 4s for theta equals to zero and theta eq uals to pi that means this position as well as this position we have theta is equals sigma theta is equals to 4s so this is a particular type of situation where we have very high stress concentration at the diametrical point one is tensile in nature this is tensile in nature this is compressive in nature and those goes to the magnitude of four times the stress applied on it and in this particular case if we go for a stress transformation we can find out that at forty-five degree angle there is a pure shear is orie nted pure shear is developed so hence for a large plate under pure shear the maximum tangential stress at the boundary of the hole is four times larger than the applied pure shear why it is saying tangential stress because whatever the sigma theta we are talking about here also it is acting this way here also it is acting this way that is the reason we say this is tangential stress so this is negative compressive in nature these two are tensile in nature so with that node with this critical point of discus sion which may be experienced by some part of the structure we will move further to discuss this thing with respect to the application refer slide t ime one thousand, nine hundred and fifty-three so we have few points to discuss let us try the high stress concentration found at the edg e of a hole is of greater practical importance so already we have discussed we need to consider this things will come again as an example hole in the cabin of an aircraft fuselage may be mentioned so this is very very important case aircraft comet disas ter took place they are they used some rectangular type of window if something like this shape corners were round but not serve but from there because of the different stress condition the fuselage got tear apart and that was the problem it happened ther e were many many catastrophic failures and after that the design got modified people did lot of experiments with strain gauges applied on those areas hope you are aware of strain gauges strain gauges are the gauges what we based on the structure put on t he structure to find out strains so that is very very important decision people have learned and the crack propagation and fracture has come to a with a very very important subject of discussion so with that what we go further with the skin of the fu selage band tension or compression is produced in the skin and there is a high stress concentration at the holes under the cyclic cycles of stresses produced by the aerodynamic loads landing and takeoff fatigue of the metal can be over stressed portions sorry fatigue of the metal at the overstressed portions may result finally in fatty cracks so along with that one more phenomena is talked about that is the fatigue that means with repeated loading properties of the structure changes capacity to withstand crack changes it becomes prone to failure and those studies again that is a separate area of discussion so people have studied those areas and seen that if this type of situations are there we need to reinforce the parts surrounding this we generally put a nother reinforcing ring around surrounding this with rivets because we cannot have a structure where we do not have any hole so once we reinforce it we make it more stress with stress with standing portion then the nature and distribution of stresses change and then we get a structure which is safe to use so with that note we proceed further refer slide t ime two thousand, three hundred and forty-one so here we will bring we want to derive the equations but we will try to use the equation for understanding so let us see it is often ne cessary to reduce the stress concentration at holes such as access holes in airplane wings and fuselage there are many access holes not only that we need those holes to reduce weights we need those holes and areas to say for wing ribs if you look at thos e there are so many holes because in civil aircraft may predominantly fuel is stored in the wing so unless we have hole how can we store so the wheel we need to lay the fuel pipes and other avionic other control equipments through those ribs so we need to have holes we cannot have a structure without a hole but at the same time we need to use those properly so that it does not go to failure the analytical problem has been solved by extending the method employed for the hole and results have been compar ed with strain gauge measurement so what is done this can be done by adding a reinforcing ring as i have shown in the last slide in general we put a reinforcing ring around that particular hole and that prevents a lot so with that note we proceed furthe r to this particular type case in an elliptical hole which is oriented this way is made in an infinite plate under tension s with one of the principal axis parallel to the tension the stresses at the ends of the axis of the hole perpendicular to the directi on of the tension are sigma is equals to s one two a by b at this point so where 2a is the axis of the ellipse perpendicular to the tension and 2b is the other axis we are talking about theta definitely we are talking about stress in this direction so thi s derivation is little bit lengthy and it takes time so that i s the reason it has been skipped you may find it in any theory of elasticity book so what we do a very large center slender hole or while a by b is large that means this is a whole something l ike may be this type of ellipse or maybe may be more perpendicular to the axis of the tension causes a very high stress concentration why in this particular case a by b ratio is high if a by b ratio is high you see this stress jumps if it is equal it is 3s as the circular case of hole if it is more it increases so that is very very good phenomena to increase so as the hole becomes thin or the ellipse ratio changes a is much more than the b then the stress concentration at this particular point becomes very high this explains why cracked transverse to the applied force tends to spread so if you think about a crack that crack also may be assumed something like a ellipse and but having a and b a different value a is definitely high very high in compari son to b and that initiates and propagates the crack the spreading can be stopped this is very very intelligent way of doing it in practical life the spreading can be stopped by drilling a hole at the ends of the crack to eliminate the sharp curvature r esponsible for the high stress concentration so as soon as if we talk about if we find some crack here and if we put a hole drill a hole around this what will happen the stress is limited they are up to only 3s it is not more than 3s so that arrests a c rack so with that intelligent way of adjusting crack people work in practical situations where it is difficult to prevent the structure by replacing it or by reinforcing it in some other manner in some cases this trick is this i should not say trick this intelligent way is applied and with that note on crack propagation stress concentration we would like to come to the end of the lecture refer slide t ime two thousand, nine hundred and thirteen refer slide t ime two thousand, nine hundred and nineteen and we come to the standard usual slide of references and with that note we come to the end of the week seven lecture where we have discussed stress concentration around a whole and with that note i thank you for attending this lecture we will meet again in the 8th week lecture thank you"}

course and this is professor anup ghosh from aerospace engineering department iit kharagpur we are at the first lecture of the module eight in sequence this is the 38th lecture and we will attempt the problem of torsion in theories of elasticity approach refer slide time fifty-one so in that connection first thing what we get is the recapitulation slide in this recapitulation slide we have covered a history of solid mechanics or structural analysis starting from the beam analysis then how before the beam analysis how the theory of elasticity came in how the linear material nonlinear materials are described and then to beam analysis plate analysis vibrations who did what all those things we have we have learned and we have seen that the development is still going on the most recent development may be in the area of cell analysis which is very very important structure while we try to analyze aircraft structure where all the members probably are curved in nature and thin in dimension in thelateral direction so it belongs to the cell group after that what we have learned is that how an aircraft experiences load or how does it withstand load where from the loads come in case of aerodynamic loads there are different conditions like rolling pitching or normal aerodynamic lift load or may be gassed or maybe an engine out condition from propulsion side all those loads where and how it comes we have discussed so far to some extent we have also seen different type of aircraft structures how those are fabricated how does they look like how do they look like and then we have seen different types of loading envelope flight enveloped a new concept is applied for different types of aircraft how the inertia load plays a big role and we see that that for civil aircraft where the maximum g force or inertia loads may be limited to up to twenty-eight to thirty-five or maybe approximately said as three but whereas in case of aerobatic aircrafts or a fighter aircraft it goes to maybe five fifty-five or 6g so it is it is a huge amount of change of force we need to take care so depending upon the type of aircraft we need to develop the flight envelope and we need to consider the parts of the structures to design to withstand those inertia loads not only inertia loads it also experiences many other loads as we have discussed we have seen the bending moment shear force diagram of whole aircraft segment and divided in two parts in orthogonal direction that is fuselage and wing and then shear force bending moment we have done we have done stress sorry three dimensional truss solved problem of landing gear and then we have gone to the theory of elasticity but before we go to the theory of elasticity we have solved problems related to deflection to find out deflection different energy methods we have learned and in amongst the energy method a very very important method we have learned that is the rayleigh ridge method so with that note we went further for theory of elasticity we developed several equations fifteen equations namely may be and more because compatibility is also involved there we have seen compatibility in terms of strain we have seen compatibility in terms of stresses compatibility is something which has to be maintained within a structure while we define inmathematical way in practical world all structures are continuous there is no problem but while we define it mathematically we need to define accordingly and after that solving a few problems initial small problems with inverse and semi inverse approach we have come across to the problem where we have discussed the effect of a circular hole in a plate which is uniaxially loaded and we have seen that there is a huge stress concentration because of those loads may be observed that is up to the three times of the tension applied and that is the reason it the crack opens transfers to the direction of the application of the tensile stress we have seen how we need to take care of the holes by reinforcement we have seen how a crack propagation takes place and why it is like that with help of ellipse and stress concentration equations so after that we will try to solve this week we will start to solve this week problems related to torsion refer slide time six hundred and twenty-five torsion problems what you have solved in your previous mechanics course probably is little bit different than the way it will be approached in this section the basic difference is the considerations of warping what is warping that is a big question while there is out of plane displacement out of plane means which plane we are talking about so if we consider in most of the cases what you have seen is that we considered we have considered a cylindrical shaft whichis fixed here and we applied some torsion t and what we see say we have observed or assume that if we consider any of one of this plane that plane remains at that plane but it rotates but there is no displacement in this direction that is what we said as outer plane displacement so out of plane from the plane of the cross section of the circular member so if there is some displacement out of plane we call that as a warping warping is a phenomena we need to learn because practically if we do if it is a non circular section we observe a warping very predominant way for example if we consider a rectangular bar what will happen if we apply a torsion this will deform like this and this will continue for all sections i have exaggerated the thing it is difficult to draw all the portions but this outer plane this corner is coming down and the other two corners are going up this type of phenomena is known as the warping so if it is a non circular section we need to take care of that and how do we take care that is first established or developed by prandtls and those assumptions the way it has been done that we will learn slowly in very small segments of small lectures so let us proceed with that note refer slide time nine hundred and fifty-three so what do we see the torsion problem the well known torsion null equations for circular shaft solid or hollow is tau shear stress developed is t r by j and the theta per rotation per unit length twist angle of twist or rotation per unit length is where t is the applied torsional movement and j is the polar moment of the cross section as i said saint venant started the analysis and then laterpandors also worked on it in this approach to the torsion problems following assumptions are made the body is cylindrical do not think that cylindrical means a circular cross section the body is cylindrical with the axis lying along the z axis axis system will see in the next page we have drawing for displacement equations we will see the unit angle of twist theta is constant along z axis here comes the most important assumption the projections of the cross of sections of x y plane rotates as rigid bodies earlier we did not use this term projections we said that the sections on the xy plane rotates as rigid bodies so that is the difference here we say the projections of this so with that considerations we will go so if a particular section is projected on the xy plane that rotates as a rigid body not that section completely so there is out of plane deformation and we need to take care of that refer slide time one thousand, two hundred and two so let us try to define the displacement first with respect to torsion in this section it is the description of the problem first this assumption restricts the problem to the torsion of a cylindrical body with no axial restraint at the ends why it says like that let us read and will come back again there are essentially two limiting torsional problems namely that of free torsionin which the cross sections are free to work please note that in case of free torsion sections are free to warp or free to deform out of plane with respect to the xy plane and that is restrained torsion and that of restraints torsion in which at least one cross section usually at one end of the cylinder is constrained to remain parallel to the xy plane so here what we are considering that no plane is restrained even the case we discussed for the circular the figure i have drawn in the last slide it is not like that no part was even this plane as well as also this plane no plane is restricted to deform out of the plane or the xy plane here with respect to the xy it is quite clear the analysis that follows will therefore be the free torsion problem so what we will consider in this particular case is for the free torsion so that for the free torsion what how are we going to define the displacement and how do we get the first starting equation with that small note we will end todays lecture so let us try to go forward refer slide time one thousand, four hundred and twenty here we have it so initially this section this is the section of the cylindrical body bottom section this dotted one is the top section and then there is a torsional force applied on this body and we have seen that theta is the rotation per unit length so the total rotation here is theta multiplied by z because from this point to this point or the segment of the cylinder cylindrical body we areconsidering is the off length z now with that considerations considering xy is like this similarly xy is also here at this plane we are considering the displacement at this particular point we define that a point p which is r its distance apart from the axis or the z axis is rotated to p prime here both are p prime because initially this was the p prime point and then after rotation after application of the torsion it has rotated to this point now with this concept what uh how do we get the displacement and other equations let us try to see plane containing p prime is rotated with respect to the plane containing p with application of a torsional moment now u is equals to r theta z sine alpha and v is equals to r theta z cos alpha this is not derived here why the minus is coming why it is not like that i would suggest you to do this as homework because if we go for the geometric way drawing the components and other things it becomes difficult to understand so we need to find u v as we have discussed that finding u and v in geometric way is much more difficult so following trigonometric approach probably will help so what we can assume that as it is the drawing what is prevailing here we will draw the same thing same phenomena in a different way so let us this is the xy plane and with r i think i need to revise it say this is the point represented as x one y one and after and this is the angle alpha and after rotation it goes somewhere here which is x two y two now this is theta z say if we simply consider u u is equals to r cos alpha r cos theta z alpha so if you simply do it you will get this relation and the similarly v also you can find out so with that i think we can proceed you can solve this easily so what do we have since we have the other relations like x is equals to r cos alpha and y is equals to r sin alpha u becomes minus of y theta z and v becomes x theta z z is not subscript please be careful z is never subscript so that is what is written here repeatedly and we define one more important function w function of xy this function is the difference with respect to our previous things from the stress strain relation this is known as the warping function from the stress strain relations and strain displacement deformation relations we get this this willbe repeated in next slide also we will use it sigma x sigma y and all those will let us see how do we come to the equilibrium equation refer slide time two thousand so with this note what we see is that we have all the six components of stresses here and if we substitute these values what we have got the displacement because of the torsion if we substitute all those values here we finally get that sigma x sigma y sigma z and tau x y is equals to zero you can easily substitute this and check have checked several times please note that this a and b are written in a generic form which are function of alpha e and mu e and mu is the sorry is expressed in terms of e and mu then tau yz and tau xz are the two remaining stress components and if we substitute these values here what do we get we get this is a simple substitution in this we get that tau yz equals to z x theta plus del w del y and tau tau yz is this tau x z is z del w del x y theta so one two three are the three equations in case of free torsion problem w is obtained from equilibrium conditions equilibrium condition without any body force which is the third equilibrium condition we need to bring because of because all other terms are zero only this equation will lead to equation what we is what is useful so simple substitution of that here what do we get is that we get a function in terms of w and which may be stated as that grad square w is equals to zero so for a torsion problem to solve our equilibrium equation is grad square w or the working function is equals to zero so with that note letus stop here for the development of torsional problem we will come back in the next lecture with a few more concept and we will go through it refer slide time two thousand, two hundred and forty-six refer slide time two thousand, two hundred and fifty-three so we come to the standard references what we need to follow and what we have learned or initiated is the torsion problem as the theory of elasticity approach and at the end i thank you for attending this lecture and we will come back with some more lectures soon thank you"}

one course this is professor anup ghosh from aerospace engineering department iit kharagpur we are in the continuation of 8th week lecture today is lecture number thirty-nine in the domain of theory of elasticity with an aim to solve a particular type of problem related to torsion of cylindrical bodies we have already covered a little bit we have come across to the displacement equations we have come across two equilibrium equations for that we got introduced to some other topics like warping and then we will do some more development or general process of analysis today depending on the stress function and then in the fourth comic lecture we will solve a specific problem in relation to torsion refer slide time one hundred and twenty-eight so before we go into the topic today\u2019s topic it is time to recapitulate as we have started with the history of solid mechanics or structural analysis the physicist famous physicist started this avenue long ago probably with the experiment of leonardo da vinci it started he tried toestimate the strength of and where is a nice experiment we have discussed not only that history we have also come across to the development of aircraft from kitty hawk flight to present day huge aircrafts including the a380 or antonov two hundred and twenty-five so then we have come across to various types of loads conceptual structural details various types of loads in the sense while it is in runway or it is airborne what are the types of loads are encountered by an aircraft and not only that we have gone into detail of how thin wall sections are used to fabricate fuselage and wings different sparse got introduced to different components with names the role of those components also we got introduced we also got introduced which part experience what type of loads more and which part is designed for what type of loads those with picture preview we have seen we have come across one agency known as airworthiness agency also which guides the critical uh conditions they have laid down some critical conditions loading parameters for design after that we have gone to the flight envelope load factor how it is different for different type of aircraft we have seen or carried out examples to find out bending moment diagram and shear force diagram of aircraft wing and fuselage truss is the next structure three dimensional stress also we have used and in this we have solved problems relation related to aircraft landing gear which is generally solved considering three dimensional structure concept or stress concept then we have come across to the deflection determination procedures different types of structures not only determinate in determinate also we have solved and we have found out indeterminate reactions external reactions as well as deflection at different points and in this method we have come across with the complementary energy method we have come across to the total potential energy method unit load method dummy load method we have also learned a very very important method known as rayleigh method castiglione\u2019s theorem is also covered and then after that we have come or we have started learning the theory of elasticity approach in theory of elasticity approach we have we have developed several equations to find out stress strain and displacement in that relation we haveseen that there are fifteen such unknowns six stress components six strain components and three displacement components so we have found out equations corresponding to those we have also seen the compatibility equations or a compatibility condition which is very very important to satisfy while we are we are describing a physical entity in terms of mathematics so displacement strain and stresses should maintain the compatibility continuity to some extent so that we have seen and then we have solved a few problems two different approaches we have learned one is an inverse method and the other is semi inverse method and then we have solved a very very important problem in theory of elasticity that is the last point here mentioned as the effect of circular hole on stress distribution in a plate we have seen that even it is uniaxially loaded if there is a hole irrespective of the dimension of the hole the stress tensile stress reaches to thrice the uniform stress experienced by the plate in one direction that is a considerably more stress and that is the reason we have studied it so that tensile stress is responsible for opening we have also seen some critical conditions where how maximum stress may be experienced and we have seen that in case of pure shear or while a piece a rectangular segment a plate is under in plane tension and compression it experiences about four times the tension or compression stress so that is also very very important point to note we have also discussed problems with in relation to crack propagation we have not gone into crack propagation in detail but a starting point or may be a glimpse of that area we have seen we have considered some elliptical hole and then we have seen that how at the tip the stress becomes very very high and leads to failure it propagates we have also seen that it is a very easy way to arrest the crack if we if we are able to drill a hole at the tip of the crack so that that restricts the stress to the three thrice the stress experienced in general so with those nodes we have attempted the cylindrical body of irregular cross section not circular cross section and then we have tried to find out the equilibrium equations and then with the stress function approach we will see how these things can be solvedrefer slide time eight hundred and forty-four so that is what the stress function approach will be covering today and in this stress function approach how do we get the other equations that we will see refer slide time eight hundred and fifty-six so the stress function methods of solution stress function method of solution let us consider the free torsion case discussed above so again we are already introduced to the concept of free torsion what is free torsion we have assumed that no cross section not even the end cross section is restrained to deform out of its plane and that is the reason we are saying it is a free torsion will be solving that type of problemand if it is there if it is a non circular cross section we will see it experiences warping so we have seen with drawing in the last class that how a rectangular bar experiences warping and how it gets deformed in a quick look we can again bring back that if this is the cross section the top surface deforms something like this and it continues for the total so similarly for all the surfaces it happens like that so this warping is not possible unless it is it is a free torsion so considering that we have seen that the equilibrium equations since sigma theta sigma this this this condition holds sigma x not sigma theta sigma r sigma x sigma y sigma z and tau xy xy is which plane we always consider that this is x this is y and this is z so there is no tau xy so whatever is there is that tau xz or tau yz so it is the other sense if we say instead of saying xz yz we can better say that tau zx tau zy that means in this plane whatever is acting is there and that is acting either in this direction or it is in this direction so that is the reason this one is we say that tau zx and this one we say that is tau zy so with this concept what we have seen is that it holds the equilibrium equation as stated here and one more thing i remember now last class i forgot to mention while we were finding out the displacement u and v the equations whatever we found out there we are supposed to consider that theta z is very very small and cos theta z is equals to one and sine theta z is equals to theta z unless you consider that we would not get the uv expressions what you we have used in the last lecture so with that small note let us proceeds excuse me so with that small note let us proceed further refer slide time 1258so this may be satisfied by stress function phi this equilibrium equations where the stress function is defined in terms of tau zx and tau zy or yz as it is given one is positive the other is negative and the derivative is also may be noted tau zx is with respect to y tau zy is with respect to x and minus so this one two three is nothing but these are the equations i have brought again to that so if we use these equations and these relations easily we can say that the grad square tau yz is equals to zero so these two relations hold so del two tau y z del x two del two tau y z del y two is equals to zero plus this is equals to zero and del two tau zx del x two plus del two tau zx del y two is also equals to zero so with this node we proceed to the next slide refer slide time 1405with respect to the stress function if we take back we you can easily see that del del x of grad square phi is equals to zero and del del y of dr square phi is also equals to zero from which we can say since this is x derivative and this is y derivative and both are coming to zero there must be it must be equated plus of these two must be equals to some constant value and that is why from mathematical conclusion why we get that we consider that this is a constant value and generally this constant is given by in this particular discussion as f so with that note let us see what we have thus any function satisfying the above equation will satisfy the compatibility and equilibrium conditions and will yield stress found from the derivatives of the stress function so it is quite clear if phi satisfies these and if we know the phi we can find out the stresses the functions will correspond to the problem in hand if it is also satisfying the given boundary conditions of the problem so boundary condition has to be satisfied for a particular type of problem and then it will represent that particular problems solution the fundamental boundary condition in the torsion problem is determined by the fact that the outer surface of the cylindrical body is free of any normal stress this is quite important we do not assume any force on the outer body and if we do some mathematical jugglery that i have skipped what do we get we get a nice equation which is there in the next page refer slide time 1605this equation we get and let us see considering equilibrium of the general three dimensional element that is what from the equilibrium concept of external forces whatever we you are taught earlier if you follow those things and if you follow a simple steps as described in all almost all standard books you will find out that it shows that it may be proved that the torsional moment t holds the following relation with respect to the stress function phi so this is satisfied so this you may say as the boundary condition with respect to the surface forces so that is the equation we have we need to satisfy this as a boundary condition for to get solution of any particular problem considering the displacement already we have found out these equations are nothing but the displacement equations rearranged in this way in the last class we have seen del w del x tau z x divided by g theta y and del w del y is equals to tau zy by z theta x now if we follow this operation that means if we divide it take a derivative with xy and x this is y and this is x and then if we subtract so this left hand side portion will vanish and we will have a relation with respect to this this this and this that is what we have here and since we are taking derivative of this part with respect to y this y also will become one so only theta remains so one by z del tau zx del y del tau z y del x is equals to two thetanow as we have seen in the previous lecture or maybe in the previous slide if we substitute the value of tau zx and tau zy what do we get we get back the equation where it says that del two phi del y square del two phi del x square is equals to a constant or may be defined as f this equation we have come across already here in this case and so once we get that equation in a different way we say that that f is nothing but the constant minus g two theta so that is satisfied refer slide time one thousand, eight hundred and forty-four so with this we come to the summary of the stress function approach what is required to solve the problem in torsion the summary we can say that the we have two expressions for tau that is tau zx and tau zy del phi del y del phi del x we have the equilibrium conditions is equals to f and f is equals to 2g theta we also have the boundary conditions which says that t is equals to two double integration phi del x del y so with that note we will end todays lecture and we will go further proceed to our next problem of finding out solution for a particular type of section that is elliptical section and in that elliptical section we can we can solve those problems and find out the solution for almost all components up to displacements refer slide time 2000so with that note we come to the slide of references these are the standard references all these problems are solved there and i thank you for attending this course refer slide time two thousand and fourteen before i thank you at that we have what we have learned in this class is that the stress function method of solution and with that note i thank you for attending this lecture and will proceed to solve a very nice problem which gives you insight into the torsional problem where wiping is inevitable unless it is a circular section and we will conclude mathematically whatever we are talking aboutwe will see that we will get the equations where if it is a circular section it would not show any warping if it is a non circular section it will show warping and not only that we will also get introduced with the with the values of the polar moment of the area what we use to find out shear stress as well as the rotation theta probably is not very very wise to use if it is a non circular section with those things let us end today\u2019s lecture thank you for attending"}

course myself anup ghosh from aerospace engineering department iit kharagpur w e are in the lecture series of the first week t his is the fourth part of the week s o we will be covering today the load enco untered by a typical aircraft so what we have covered so far refer slide time one hundred and five we have covered so far is important to keep a track on it w e have already done a historical background o f aerospace structural analysis w e have seen the contribution of a physicist scientist starting from leonardo da vinci to maybe koiter sanders and i n between leibniz euler kirchhoff mindlin hooke there are many it is an endless list with their contribution we are able to fly today definitely we should not forget the contribution of wright brothers on the day of 17th december one thousand, nine hundred and three the first c ontrolle d aircraft flight at kitty hawk then from there in the second lecture we have covered the development of aircraft in this lecture we have seen how the aircraft development has taken place from the first one and then we have got a fair idea of how big an aircraft can be or whether how small it can be and what is the basic structural difference between the aircraft s it is almost same w e have seen aircrafts in size range of a football field to the size range of like a car and configuratio n there are many configurations high wing mid wing low wing tail configuration different landing gear configuration different and depending on that how the structures changes s o let us move to todays lecture refer slide time three hundred and six todays lecture is mainly t wo things we will be covering and most of the lecture is on various types of external loads encountered by an aircraft and concepts of stress ed skin structure t his we will you just introduce we will cover in the next lecture in more detail but our main stress will be on these various types of external loads refer slide time three hundred and forty-three so if we see an aircraft structure is designed from thin load bearing skins frames and stiffeners s o this is the most important difference between the other s tructures and aircraft structures it is thin and there are frames stiffeners it bears loads definitely skins also be ar a small amount of load t hese are fabricated from lightweight high stren gth materials the lightweight high strength materials t he most popular material was the different alloys of aluminium presently there are different laminated composites are available those are being used forming of metal sheets as i told you is the basic process for aluminium alloys generally forming proces s is used to fabricate different shapes and then using those shapes the aircraft is generally built h igh specific sti ffness of a material is desirable s pecific stiffness is a quantity by which we generally define with respect to its weight how stiff it i s then different aluminium alloy and laminated composite materials are most widely used in this type of structures for example s o details of this will come later let us move to the different types of loads encountered by structure refer slide time five hundred and forty-two so loads on structural components mainly or the total overall aircraft is mainly divided in to two groups f irst is the ground load s and the next is the air loads t here are some other subdivi sions from an engineering point of view but these are f rom the source from where it is coming on that at the ground while it is airborne or it is flying f rom ground load if you talk about ground loads include all loads encountered by the aircraft during movement on transporta tion on the ground such as taxi landing loads towing and hoisting we need to taxi in the airport to come to the takeoff point and during that an aircraft is hugely loaded by the fuel fuel is generally stored in the wing in all civil aircrafts and during that any small bump in taxi ing genera lly creates a lot of disturbances a lot of loads in the wing fuselage junction t hat becomes very important s o landing load is definitely com ing through the landing gear to the fuselage it bears the impact towing we need to o while it is at the airport we need to tow it from one place to the other we need to move it back to steer for steering req uirement also we need to tow it hoisting for maintenance purposes we need to hoist it where to hoist and how to hoist that is very important t here are specific positions for hoisting to prevent damage and if we look at the air loads air loads come in the form of it comprises loads imposed on the structure during flight by manoeuv res and gust carrier borne aircraft s are subjected to catap ult takeoff and arrested landing loads t his is another importa nt specific type of requirement aircraft carriers usually use catap ult takeoff system and arrested landing system so during that it has to bear the loads on the fuselage through th at catap ult so t hose loads a lso have to be carried by the fuselage most large civil and military aircrafts have the pressurized cabin for high altitude flight this is another important thing w e generally have a huge pressure difference at the altitude we fly and altit ude at sea level so to comp ensate that pressure difference generally the cabins are pressurized and that in troduces a load on the fuselage so we need to take care of that not only these where from the loads are coming but it is also depende nt on othe r engineering aspects further cla ssification we may do surface forces which act up on the surface of the structure in general the dy namics and hydrostatic pressure it comes on the wing b ody forces which act upon the entire volume of the structure and are produced by gra vitational and inertial effects so during flight this inertial effect is very important and these effects create extra load on the structure and gravitational force is always there to act so combining all these things these are the b asic classifications of aircraft loads refer slide time one thousand and four so basically all these loads are the result of the pressure distribution over the surface of the skin produced by steady flight manoeuv re or gust conditions generally these loads cause direct loads bending loads shear loads shear and torsio n in all parts of the structure i n addition to local normal pre ssure loads imposed on the skin s o this is some of the loads what is generally encountered by a n aircraft while from the flight condi tion that is why it is said as basic a erodynamic loads on an aircraft so if we see for different manoeuvre as well as for flying we have different types of loads to fly w e generally need the lift that acts on the wing and that carri es the total fuselag e structure inside that the cargo or other payloads are there but during flight for control purpose to take off and to land the main control surface s that is horizontal tail plane these two horizontal t ail planes t hese two also experiences aerodynamic loads for pitching stability and th is is for the lateral stability the v ertical tail plane directiona l control and lateral stability for yaw movement control this the forces coming o n that this is generally used and the other forces generally create d by the rudder or the elevator portion and rolling moment if we took at is general ly acted by the aileron portion s o all these the rolling moment s create the partial difference between the lift of these two wing s and due to that rolling moment it rolls a nd we need to do the drag is also acting on the airc raft that has to be encountered as i told a few minutes back the pitching moment is very important characteristics aircraft weight acts th rough the cg or center of gravity point of it so as a combin ed manner it experiences in general these loads but we will see further specifications for the diffe rences between these loads okay refer slide time one thousand, three hundred and fourteen so the force on an aerodynamic surface wing vertical or horizontal tail results from a differential pressure d istribution caused by incidence camber or combination s o we will not go into detail of how th ese pressure profile s is created why camber or other things assist in increasing lift and in flying the aircraft ea sily but as a result we have lift we have drag we have a pitching moment s o these things have to be encountere d by a wing that we need to see refer slide time one thousand, four hundred and eight so another important thing is the distribution of the load t he distri bution of the load is important t he lift is distri buted not uniformly on the wing if we look at along the span along the span it is followed it has a distribution similar to this and along the cord if you look at that also has a different type of distributio n so as a whole region are so metimes simplify the total effect in this form chordwise and spanwise lift distribution sometimes wherever possible we consider the spanwise distribution in this form and we need to find out this load along with the other loads like if we have a n engine here that e ngine load has to be considered loads coming from that engine s o that wi ll come later in our discussion refer slide time one thousand, five hundred and twenty-five so if we look at the possible design conditions of parts of an aircraft from the aerodynamic loads if we loo k at there are many positions and which are gover ned by different types of loads l et us try to see which part is governed by which type of load so as we have seen so the design of this portion of the wing is generally govern ed by the positive dynamic g ust this portion of the wing we need to fix the aileron with the ribs or with the wing structure aileron comes this way so that has to be fixed with the wing and we need to design that portion that aileron load has to be transferred here i f we look at the root section that is positive man oeuvre and static gust i f we look at the front portion of the fuselage that is negative man oeuvre and breaking t his is also designed for the gust governs this portions design positive dynamic gust and lateral gust governs the design of this portion landing gear taxiing jacking and towing from the front landing gear all thes e operations are generally done s o those things the design of landing gear is governed by those loads t his portion of the fuselage is gover ned by the loads coming from the positive manoeuvre this portion the lower po rtion is from the negative gust t his for taxi ing as i told you this is very important in general the fuel tanks are located as the box in this port ion and different boxes are there so if we look at the different boxes on th is and while it is taxiing this this wing is completely full of fuel and this portion while taxiing is very important because the fuel weight affects the design of this root junction portion during fligh t during landing most of the fuels get burned so that problem is not encountered s o if we look at the aft portion of the fuselage that is the lateral manoeuvre is the governing load lateral l oad due to the lateral man oeuvre this portion is due to th e buffett or the force induced by the buffett or the trailing wind vibration whatever comes on the horizontal tailplane that governs the design of this portion as a whole though the structure of the fuselage remains almos t the same from the tip to the tail but different portions are designed for different loads l ike that wing construction basically is si milar from the root to the tail but there are different requirements which govern the des ign of that particular portion refer slide time one thousand, nine hundred and thirty-two so if we see what the reference we have considered for this is the references are wang a book of wang donaldson bruhn rivello megson and peery and azar refer slide time one thousand, nine hundred and fifty-three so if we come to a conclusion this conclusion slide consists of a few bullets which are thin lightweight metallic or laminated composites with high specific stiffness are used for aircraft structures in general two types of loads are experi enced by aircraft structures aerodynamic load and ground load c onceptual details of the loads as encountered by an aircraft has been discussed so with this we will conclude this load portion and we will move forward for more detail or conceptual detail of structures of an aircraft"}

professor anup ghosh from aerospace engineering department iit kharagpur we are in the continuation of 8th week lecture this is the 40th lecture in that equations sequence today we will try to solve problems related to torsion of an elliptical bar this is very interesting problem this shows the mathematical way of how the warping takes place we have talked about warping in the last two lectures i have shown you drawing figures also but in this particular case for rectangular bar i have shown you how the warping takes place we have done experiments and we have seen observed those things we do regularly that type of experiments as a regular lab of of btec students and with that note we will proceed further to solve todays problem refer slide time one hundred and twenty-four in this before we go into solving the problems what we will do we will go for a recapitulation as it is listed there today i would not discuss much about what we have done i will try to simply read it history of aircraft and aerospace structural analysis various types of external loadsconceptual structural details we have covered we have also come across a flight envelope and different load factors experienced by different types of aircrafts why it is different how it is different all those things we have discussed we have drawn bending moment shear force diagram considering typical loading unit load method we have used we have considered those things and solved found out the surface bending moment diagram then we have come to the three dimensional structures or the space structures solved a few problem related to landing gear then energy methods we have solved different problems not only determinate indeterminate problems also we have solved found out indeterminate reactions redundant forces and then in that method we have come across two unit load method dummy load method and other methods related to rayleigh rich method rayleigh method is really very very important one and we follow those in further derivation or further numerical processes then we have learned the stress elasticity approach elasticity approach of solving problems i have already said many times why theory of elasticity is so important in a brief we can say unless we learn the theory of elasticity approach of solving a problem it is difficult to have a insight into the development of stresses and strains inside a body while it is loaded unless we have the insight it is difficult to predict catastrophic situations or failures and those criteria so that is the reason we need to study the theory of elasticity approach and we have covered those things one very very important problem we have solved in a week long session that is the circular hole stress due to a circular hole on a plate while it is loaded uniaxially even in biaxial nature we have seen if the hole is elliptical how it changes and in the last two lectures what is not listed here we have developed equations to solve torsion of cylindrical bodies it is not considered we will our approach is not considering the section as circular and at the end of this lecture we will come to the section as circular and we will conclude that how it is conforming to the usual solution with that note we proceed further refer slide time 0426and torsion of an elliptical bar is the problem what we will be solving today refer slide time four hundred and thirty-three so with that the problem what we will be solving is an elliptical section having a semi major axis and b semi minor axis let us consider a bar with an electrical cross section under the action of free torsion again free torsion is there as we have said unless it is free torsion warping is difficult to observe and that is the reason warping has been introduced and has been observed here if a and b are the semi major and same inner minor axis respectively of the ellipse the equation of the equal elliptical boundary is given by x square by a square y square by b square one is equals to zero its quite well learnedagain since phi must be a constant on the boundary we can assume for it an equation of the form what is equal to similar to the equation of the ellipse so phi is equals to a constant m multiplied by the x square by a square y square by b square \u2013 one refer slide time five hundred and fifty so phi as we have defined in the last slide from equilibrium equation if you substitute this what do we have del two phi del y two del two phi del x two is equals to constant as we have seen and that constant we get the value of m its simple rearrangement we have done and if we substitute back to that the phi takes the form as it is said a square b square by twice a square b square multiplied by f and the remaining portion is part of the ellipse equation the value of s if is determined by the use of boundary condition so that boundary condition whatever we have earlier stated we have not derived this but it can be derived from the boundary condition surface forces boundary condition easily so if we put the value of phi here and we carry out write the equations in a segmented manner what do we have we have x square by s square d x d y square by b square dx dy and this is dx dy so if we this terms are quite familiar is not it if you try to remember we will find that this you have already solved refer slide time 0713as area moment of inertia so we know from the previous calculations that the moment of inertia of the cross section about y axis is x square by del dx dy that is i y similarly this is y square dx dy is i x integration definitely is there and integration dx dy is equals to the area so now if we find the integration of these things so i x is equals to pi a cube b by four i y is equals to pi a cube b by four i x is equals to pi a b cube by four and a is by ab as we know refer slide time eight hundred and two so with that note we come to a simple solution for t and we write that f may be written as \u2013 2t x square v square by pi a cube b cube so now we have one more expression for the a earlier we had an expression with respect to theta now from the boundary conditions implementation whatwe have the expression of f the constant as in terms of t so easily we can correlate those two so but it is not done here it may be done later so the stress function may be then written as t by pi a b x square by a square y square by b square one is equals to this now once we have the stress function in terms of the applied torsion so we can easily find out the shear stress shear stress experienced by a particular section so as i mentioned z along x z along y del phi del y and we simply take derivative of this you can easily do i think and what do we get is t y by two i similarly for the other direction in the y direction in the z plane the shear stress is t x by 2i y refer slide time nine hundred and forty-six so to have some discussion with respect to the shear stresses as we have seen so if we look at the expression along with the along the x axis and y equals to zero we find that that means if we follow this axis what do we have since y is equals to zero the y expression if you look into the previous slide you will find that tau zx is equals to zero and tau zy is having some value so if we try to draw it here we have only value may be increasing linearly why because it is a function of x and this value is the maximum value what do we have if we substitute x is equals to a we have this value is 2t by pi a square b and we do not have the other component zx is missing in this direction there is no shear stress shear stress is acting only in this direction and the maximumvalue is plus minus this because one may be this direction the other may be in the other direction that is the reason it is said plus minus this similarly at x equals to a at x equals to a up to this is this one so similarly along the y axis the x is equals to zero if we follow this line x is equals to zero what do we have again we have that this is equals to minus so if it is equals to minus we can have and this value is the maximum value that is 2t by pi a b square ok so that is what at the plus minus even here also we will have so with that note we observe that for an elliptical section at the boundary the stresses are not same it is different and it is not that every point there are tau xz x as well as tau yz in between any point if you consider whatever may be the point we have values tau zx as well as tau zy i think i have written wrong zx and tau zy so with that note and with the distribution of shear stress this is very very important understanding in my opinion we will proceed further for this type of solution what else we have to see to have some insight so unless a repeat unless it is on this line there are shear stress components both tau zx as well as tau zy and with that note we proceed further to solve or observe other properties refer slide time one thousand, three hundred and fifty-eight since a is greater than b as drawn we find that the maximum value of shearing stress will occur at the ends of the minor axis of the ellipse so from the expressions easily you can say one iswhat is the expression one is 2t pi a square by b the other is 2t pi a b square since a is larger this value is more that is what is said so the amplitude here will be more whereas amplitude here will be less the drawing what i drawn last time probably showing the same amplitude but it is not the same amplitude what we have is that to notice that we find that the maximum value of shearing stress will occur at the ends of the minor axis of the ellipse so the maximum value will occur at this place or at this place these point this point the resultant value of tau at any point in the cross section is given by it is as usual it is very easy formality formula to observe and we have the resultant value as given here as 2t by pi a b over square root of y square by b to the power four x square by a to the power four which indicates that the value of tau is constant and correspond to a family of ellipse so family of ellipse means where this the a by a b ratio is maintained and there is a relations which satisfies this equation in those ellipse it is constant all resultant shearing stress is constant so with that node we proceed further refer slide time one thousand, six hundred and twenty-one to determine the unit angular twist of any torsional moment we make use of the equations as we have done earlier f equals to two g theta and then if we put that what we have as i mentioned in the previous slide that there we got expression with f with respect to t and put it to find out phihere we are putting the same value and getting the equations for theta theta is equals to t by g j effective where from the j effective is coming we are in it is quite known that theta is equals to two by gj j is the polar moment of inertia of the section now but in this elliptical case what we observe that j effective or from this equation the j effective is having some different value that is pi a cube b cube by divided by a square b square and whereas if we find out the usual way of a polar moment of inertia of that particular section of ellipse as we have described earlier with semi major axis as a and say minor axis as b we get the expression something like this is written in a special way to cancel out a few terms so if you take a ratio of this and this what do we have is equals to four square b square divided by a square b square whole square and let us try to observe what happens if we assume j is j p or e is equals to j effective refer slide time one thousand, eight hundred and twenty-four to study that if with respect to the variation of a and b we have prepared a plot it is available in almost all good books so with that what is that plot we have plotted the j effective by j p in the y axis and in the x axis we have plotted the ellipse semi major and say minor axis ratio that is a by b as it is pointed out here so what do we see if it is one that means it is a circular section in that particular case there is no change of this value the ratio that ratio is equals to one but as it becomes the ellipse there is a considerable change of this valueat some point while the a by b is equals to five or it is very very slender or thin ellipse if we talk about in that particular case it is the value is about two here about say about say four hundred and twenty-five or somewhere it is about two and that is a considerable change in value of j p and definitely there will be a constant they were sorry considerable change in the tau as well as theta but a simple observation you can see that what is happening the j effective is increasing that is the reason we get the value in fraction so as it becomes more elliptic from the circular the j effective value is increasing and from there the theta value is decreasing if we look at that manner what is happening if the torsion applied torsion remains same the angle of twist reduces right so with that note we proceed further refer slide time two thousand and thirty-four now to find out the displacement so to find out displacement the deformation u and v may be obtained by means of the equations already you have we have found out now it is time to replace only the value of theta t by g j effective is put there here also it is put it is integrated once we integrate it again del w del x is brought back in relation to the standard way what we have seen in the equations and then what we get that w is equals to f one of y because it is partial derivative of x and similarly if we go for the w from this equation we have a function of x since it is derivative with respect to y refer slide time 2139so now it is interesting to note that in both the cases it is expressing w and to have a reasonable solution from mathematical point of view w must be equal for both values of x and y we can state set that f one y and f two x are equals to zero but w is a unique number it is not having a different value at the for different position of xy so for any value of xy since this w both the functions are certain to lead to a same value the values of f one and f two f one y and f two x are equals to zero and we get that w which is along this axis so if i consider better to have some conforming relation if this is x if this is x this is y this is z so this is the xy plane and w is in this direction now one more thing you should notice here it sometimes it is confusing i have tried to draw it as clearly as i can it is digital drawing becomes difficult so let me give you some try to explain the figure as far as i can so the initial state of the section is given by this line am i right yes i am this is the section which is not stressed or which is not experiencing any torsion but as soon as there is a torsion applied what is happening we observe that there is a out of plane displacement and this point goes inside corresponding this point comes out similarly this point goes inside this point comes out so as i showed you in case of a rectangular cross section the some opposite corners go up and the opposite corners go downin a similar manner if we see that this side this side is going down this side is also going down ok its going in this direction its going in this direction whereas this side is coming out this side is coming out so this is a nice phenomena unless you do experiment unless you observe the section it is difficult to imagine difficult to probably experience using this formula but it happens we have seen to happen its exciting phenomena so we if you carry out experiment elliptical section is difficult to find out that is the reason we always prefer to carry out experiment with rectangular section if you do rectangular section experiment i would suggest that you do draw parallel lines on the section before you give it for torsion and then at the end of the of the experiment while the specimen has failed you please observe that it will take the shape as we have described as we have got in case of elliptical section so with this note of warping is very very nice function phenomena we proceed to the next slide refer slide time two thousand, six hundred and twenty-seven for the circular bar where a is equals to b is equals to r so we come back to the simplified solution considering a and b are equals and is equals to r and we will try to see observe that the derivation whatever we have done that also holds for a circular section that is what is done a is equals to b is equals to r is put here and the tau resultant shear stress if we put those values is equals to t r by j and the theta is t by g j and j effective is also equals to j and it is equals to 1and we have u is equals to of t by g j yz and v is equals to t by g j xz w is equals to zero it can be shown that the circular cylinder either hollow or solid is the only shape in which the true geometric value of j may be used and in which there is no warping of cross section furthermore only in circular cylinder does the resultant shearing stress act perpendicular to the radius vector and is directly proportional to the distance from the center of the circle so the resultant as we have seen that there are two components always tau zx and tau zy unless it is lying on the axis so definitely it is the resultant is not going to be perpendicular to the radius so that is what is concluded in this portion and we observe that particular phenomena refer slide time two thousand, eight hundred and thirty-one so with that note we come to the end of the torsion problem of elliptical section will solve a few more if time permits so these are the standard reference what we see and with this reference refer slide time 2852we go to the next slide what we have learned today learned that torsion of elliptical section and not only elliptical section we have got some insight towards the warping phenomena and we have seen solutions conforming to the circular section also so with that note i thank you for attending the lecture we will see you later thank you"}

this is professor aanu ghosh from aerospace engineering department iit kharagpur we are in the last week lecture the eighth week lecture module eight it is named and the topic we will cover in these two lectures last two lectures is the membrane analogy for torsion problems so keeping in mind that let us proceed refer slide time fifty-four since we are we have come almost at the end of the course only one topic is remaining that is the membrane analogy with respect to torsion problem to find out torsionals rotation as well as a torsional shear stress developed in a section irregular section those things will come later but before that let us have a recapitulation of what we have done we have done history of aircraft and aerospace structural analysis or we can say that it is related to the development of aircraft from the kitty hawk site the twelve second flight from there in one thousand, nine hundred and three from there we have come to the huge aircrafts we have come to the rotary aircrafts we have come there are developments in rockets also but those things we are not going to discuss our predominant area of discussion was related to fixed wing aircraft and we haveseen how the configuration have configurations have changed from time to time different types of wing configuration tail configurations different types of purpose it serves with those configurations and we have seen that from a very small aircraft may be fitting in a classroom to a an aircraft fitting comfortably fitting in a football field people have developed human men have developed society engineers have developed that and those are in service we are being used many aircrafts are there some variation of 737ah and seven hundred and forty-seven are there which are used for fire fighting also huge quantity of water they carry and fire retardant chemicals they carry and spray it on jungle so we have seen various developments of aircraft we have also have gone from to through the we have gone through the development of solid mechanics structural analysis from the static analysis how people have come to the concept of modulus of elasticity it is constant how people have come to the concept of poissons ratio it was difficult for initially to imagine that for any isotropic material these are the two constants which defines the total material property when we are considering linear elastic region this again this linear elasticity also they defined and slowly from different experiments related to the beam it has been done with and then it has gone further in with to the plate and to the cell we have also seen developments in the direction of vibration but those are not of important in this particular course but people have developed side by side physicist scientists have developed side by side different equations they have proposed they have proposed relations for strain and displacement the famous relations proposed compatibility equations and from with all those things we are able to design huge aircrafts nowadays even huge other structures that knowledge is very very important unless we develop that insight to a to a analysis it is difficult to have a insight in that problem and to solve then various types of external loads and conceptual loads coming to the aircraft structure we have covered a different flight condition which portion of the structure is more prone to experience certain type of loads some part of fuselagesome part of wing some part of tail plane at which condition they experience what type of load and what should be the critical design condition we have also come across to the agency known as the air worthiness agency and they define and help engineers to design the aircraft according to safety norms and then what we have seen we have seen how the bending moment and shear force are experienced by wing and fuselage we have not come done any combined three dimensional way the shear force bending moment but we have considered in two dimensional manner separately as being as fuselage we have drawn shear force bending moment diagram with unit load concept so that for any kind of unit load we can solve it before that we have come across to the concept of inertia load and how inertia load is very very important in case of aircraft structures so with those notes we have come across to the flight envelope for different types of aircrafts how flight envelopes are different and we need to prepare it then three dimensional truss structures we have seen we have solved a few problems related to related to trusses and then we have seen displacement to find out deflection of different structures we started with determinate structure with energy different energy methods related to complementary energy method castiglione\u2019s theorem unit load method dummy load method and also we got introduced to a very very important energy based solution known as rayleigh method so after finding out displacement we have started learning theory of elasticity approach theory of elasticity approach is the mathematical way of formulating problems and to find out solution for that different stress conditions strain condition and displacements so and then that connection we got that for isotropic material there are fifteen unknowns to be found out to solve a problem amongst that six are stresses six are strains and three displacement components accordingly fifteen equations we have found out in that consequence we have also got introduced to the compatibility condition compatibility condition is really very important condition we need to maintain while we are formulating a problem we are trying to define mathematically a problem unless the compatibility is maintained compilingcompatibility means the continuity from point to point one point to the other in terms of strain or displacement and as well as in terms of stress so unless you maintain that in mathematically it will be a mistake because in all physical structure physical world it is always continuous there is no discontinuity like that so that concept is introduced then we have solved a few problems with inverse semi inverse method we have come got in we got introduced to the concept of stress function aris stress function was introduced and then we solved a very typical problem known as the stress concentration on the circumference of a hole if irrespective of the diameter of the hole while the plate is uniaxially loaded with uniform stress then from there we have seen that if even if it is other conditions are there what is the maximum stress may be found out on the circumference of a hole and then we have learned how a crack propagation may be correlated with elliptical hole and how it can be arrested by drilling a hole after that we have started in last three lectures we have covered the concept of torsion in theory of elasticity approach irregular prismatic sections we have considered not circular sections and then at the end we have come to the circular section also we got introduced to the free torsion where warping takes place warping is nothing but the out of plane displacement the plane here means the plane which rotates which rotates due to the torsion so it is better way to imagine mathematically it is difficult to say without drawing a figure so the warping got introduced it is out of plane displacement and then a easy way of finding out um torsion properties with same with respect to the membrane stretching to be discussed this two lectures in these two lectures refer slide time 1045so with that note let us start that discussion so we will be discussing membrane analogy for torsion problem what is membrane analogy for torsion problem refer slide time one thousand and fifty-six if we think about the process first and then if we go to the description it will be much better what is done that for a regular section maybe a rectangle maybe a circle may be a cylindrical annular cylindrical section or member we can find out torsional rotation and maximum shear stresses to design but if it is a irregular section say it is a c section a hat section or a z section which are very very popular in aircraft structuresit is difficult to find out the j effective or the polar moment of inertia effective to find out the torsional maximum shear stress as well as the rotation theta so to do that prandtl introduced some experimental method what he introduced that if we if we put a film on the cross section and if we are able to measure the internal pressure of the film and if we are able to measure the profile of the film then we can correlate that film properties to the torsional properties that is what the membrane analogy i am talking about film but i am it is written there the membrane that is because the film is considered as membrane so in experiment what is done is in general say if it is a c section if we just think of a c section we consider the c section similar to this and we put a this section is generally prepared as hollow there is nothing is put on this section it is very very thin wall section generally prepared first and then one rubber membrane is put on top of it and internal pressure is produced so because of that if i look from this side what will happen it will there will be a profile of the rubber sheet something like this here so if we are able to measure this profile and we are able to measure the p internal pressure then we can have some correlation so since a membrane is used generally for experiment people used to use these things nowadays it is not much used but if it is used this way then we can find out the maximum shear stress or resultant shear stress at any section as well as we can find out the rotation theta so with that concept let us try to have a discussion or have the equations derived the membrane analogy to the torsion problem for irregular separate bars subjected to torsion the methods show discussed may lead either to unsolvable differential equation or to lengthy approximate methods for such bars there is an analogy to the torsion problem developed by prandtl which uses the equations of uniformly stressed membrane subjected to a normal load and which makes possible an experimental solution to the torsion problem the experimental procedure just now i have described that is what is said here but unless we have the correlation between the slope between the slope as well as the pressure and the profile we would not be able to have a correlationbut before that mathematically we need to pre have the correlation that is what we will discuss so what we are trying to say that there is an element we are considering this is the irregular separate section and is a part of it as dx dy is considered and it is may be x direction it may be considered as the y direction z remains same so it is there is some internal pressures and because of that international pressure in sorry because of that internal pressure the membrane inflates like this way so these are the corners edges of this member this is the edge this is the edge and that edge is this edge the membrane is stretched over a boundary that conforms to the shape of the bar to be loaded in torsion and is subjected to a normal pressure of p psi if we write the equilibrium equation of an element we will have as the resultant force in the z direction so let us see how do we get it refer slide time one thousand, six hundred and fifteen so this derivation portion i have skipped this portion of derivation this is similar derivation with respect to the plate bending there are many more books which describes the plate bending so you can easily have this type of expression considering in plane load so we can easily see that but let us see what the concept is for the element dx dy in the direction of x we are considering in this directionthis figure may be considered here in that case this is the x direction the load experience because of the stretching is s del two z del x two dx dy acting outward acting downward this way it is acting it is negative because of the negative curvature of the membrane similarly for the y direction the force acting is s delta z del y two dx dy and if we sum it these are in this direction p is in the opposite direction we get the equation as it is given and from there we can easily come to this solution but it is reiterated the sign in the equations are correct if we consider as positive intention and p positive as drawn its going upward in the direction of z since the radius of curvature is negative for the reflection curve as indicated in figure the above equation may be written as it is divided and we get a second order differential equation partial differential equation del two z del x two del two z del y two is equals to minus of p by s so we can have a simple analogy with the equations what we have already derived which can be directly related to the stress function differ the differential equation this is where the analogy starts so from this analogy we can easily conclude that p by s is equals to 2g theta or p by s equals to \u2013f so with it this conclusion will use this property later let us proceed further refer slide time one thousand, eight hundred and forty-six so by setting the displacement of the membrane z equal to the stress function phi and constant f equals to 2g theta equal to the pressure tension ratio p by s the deflection of the membrane along any contour line is as is constant so what is happening if we think of a contour line theirregular shape what we considered that would give this type of contour line this type of contour line is generally obtained for a body which is may be elliptical in section and then it converges to an ellipse here otherwise there will be such changes of curve and the contour would be something very symmetric like this so but we can imagine a even elliptical section and we can go for the understanding the deflection of the membrane along any contour line is constant so here at particular height maybe this height if we consider this it is z is constant so that is the reason along this line the del z del s dz ds is equals to zero so which can be related to the stress function so we will be substituting z to phi and then we are rewriting the equation in a split manner so del phi del x del x del s del phi del x dx ds we are doing plus del phi del y dy ds we can write in this way and then as we have seen earlier this is nothing but minus of t zy and dx ds is there and this is nothing but tau z x this is dy ds and this is equals to zero so while we get mathematically this expression this gives us a conclusion in physical manner what is that conclusion from the stress point of view indicates that the projection of any shearing force on the normal to the contour n this is the n to the contour r equals to zero so if we consider components of tau zx or tau zy in this direction that is equals to zero and therefore the tangent to any membrane contour gives the direction of the resultant shearing stress at that point so this the tangent at that point gives us the resultant shearing stress so with this conclusion we let us see what more we can have analogy with this problem and let us see refer slide time 2146so the magnitude of the resultant shearing stress is obtained by projection of the tangent of the stress components the resultant shearing stress at any point is given by tau is equals to tau zx cos n x tau z tau zy cos n x tau z x cos n y so if you look at it first component is zy this is the n x component here actually the n x is this but a simple correlation if we geometrically if we think this becomes the component so accordingly we get that that tau is equals to this value and we get this equation and from there what we can conclude is that we can conclude that cos n x so not conclusion we can observe that cos n x is equals to dx dn where in dn is the unit normal in this direction and this cos n y is equal to dy dn and then if we substitute those values what we can say that this becomes minus of rearrangement from the conclusion that this is equals to minus d phi dn and which is since phi and z is correlated this way d this is dz dn now from there what do we conclude magnitude of the shearing stress at any point is represented by the slope of the membrane that means if we correspond to this this slope that is this so of the membrane taken perpendicular to the contour line through that points so the from the other equations what we have already derived t is equals to twice double integration phi dx dy and that can be easily approximated to the volume twice the volumeand we have the correlation we conclude that we see that the torsional moment is represented by twice the volume under the membrane which conforms to the cross section shape of the bar so this is another very very important equation we are going to use so with this note we will come again in the next lecture to find out relations for theta two relations we will find already one we have got with respect to theta but one more we will find out considering the equilibrium in s direction we come to the conclusion of this slide refer slide time two thousand, five hundred and six refer slide time two thousand, five hundred and twelve this is the standard reference slide and we proceed further to the last slide where it says that we have learnt to some extent the membrane analogy method and at the end i thank you for attending this lecture we will meet again with the next lecture thank you"}

course this is professor aanp ghosh from aerospace engineering department iit kharagpur in due process we have come to the last lecture of the total course the eighth week is going to end with this lecture the 42nd lecture in sequence and here we will have some understanding will follow or put some insight into the membrane analogy for the torsion problem and we will end the course but before we end the course it is we go into the lectures it is my duty to thank many people who has helped me from the audio visual section of iit kharagpur who has helped me to record this lecture in a very very well beautifully record this lecture beautifully and presentable to everyone my sincere thank to our departmental retired professor p k dhakta without his help probably it was a very difficult task for me to do it i also would like to thank my two students who will be teaching assistant in this course mr vikash kaushik as well as mr supen sah without their help also it is not a possible task not only that there are many other people who are involved from cet section of our institute i would like to thank each and everybody and with that note i would like to start todays lecture which is the final lecture refer slide time 0222so let us proceed so in this recapitulation slide what we see is that history of aircraft and aerospace structural analysis we have discussed we have also discussed various types of external loads conceptual structural details how a wing is fabricated what are the members structural members how does a rib looks like how does a spar looks like how thin wall sections are used to fabricate those things and we have seen where from loads come to aircraft and it experiences different critical conditions we have come across to the flight envelope we have also seen that if we consider the fuselage separately or the wing separately how does it bends how does it experiences shear force its changes we have done unit load analysis method so that for any practical case it can be achieved that particular value then three dimensional structures are given stress with as example which is very common in aircraft without which an aircraft cannot land landing is very very important so landing gear analysis with help of three dimensional structures flying is a tough job fine but unless we are able to land it is of no use so landing gear analysis we have done and then we have done various methods to find out deflection you are given the concept to find out deflection we have covered methods like complementary energy method total potential energy method we have learned castiglione\u2019s theorem we have learned unit load method dummy load method wehave also learned how to solve indeterminate structures statically indeterminate structures if there are more like the cropped cantilever that is a very common example not only that even in truss with more members are also solved then we got introduced to a very very important method known as the rayleigh ridge method of analysis which lays the foundation stone probably for the numerical analysis world from where probably it starts and it goes further and the world is now running in computer in digital world unless we have a computer unless we are able to solve we cannot design anything we need to find solution but see even the there is computer there are advanced methods of analysis like finite element analysis method or many other different methods to analyze structures unless we have the insight into the development of stresses and deflections it is difficult to design so to have that insight to have the feel of development of stresses and strengths and displacements we need to learn the theory of elasticity and in that connection we have learnt theory of elasticity we have learnt that there are compatibility conditions compatibility or continuity of stresses and strains while we are formulating a problem we need to maintain mathematically otherwise it will not going to represent the stress strain with the physical matching with the physical world or the practical world so those things we have learnt we have solved very very typical problem of circular hole in a plate then we have solved torsion problem got introduced with the phenomena known as warping it is a very beautiful phenomena to observe you may think of experiments wherever you are in your college you may ask for a torsion experiment it is not very difficult one but before you go for the torsion element a torsion experiment you should mark parallel lines so that you can observe the warping after the break after by torsion and then in the last lecture we got introduced with the membrane analogy and we will continue with the membrane analogy to find out torsional stresses and deflectionsrefer slide time seven hundred and eleven so in that connection we come to the relation between the stress and theta with respect to membrane so in this we are considering again one stretched membrane which is under pressure p the stress member is stressed on the surrounding or the edges of the structure which is under torsion if we consider the equilibrium equation of any portion of the membrane taken along a contour line the following equation results so what we can get from this equations along a contour line is that s sine alpha sine alpha is equals to dz dn integrate it along a contour line which is the i have shown you in the last lecture we can easily write that this is equals to integration over that contour line for ds length considering a small length ds is this one and that dz dn is equals to tau the slope already we have put and since we have found out a relation between this p by s equals to 2g j sorry 2g theta that if we substitute here we finally see that that whatever the pressure that total pressure is equals to p into a the total force acting in this direction and once we complete the integration we get the relation something like tau ds integration over the s tau ds is equals to 2g a theta and where ds is an increment of the distance s measured along the contour line so with that concept we move further for practical cases refer slide time 0905how do we implement this membrane analogy for solid and hollow circular sections the membranes would be as indicated in the figure below since the membrane for the solid circular section has axial symmetry the membrane for the removed portion of the hollow section is a circular membrane shown dotted in the figure this one and torsional properties of the remaining hollow cylinder are given by the dark membrane outline of the same figure so this will govern the torsional property this membrane so with that note we move further for a solid section this is the way this total membrane for a annular section where there is a hole axial hole cut in the shaft this portion of the section we are supposed to consider for thin wall let us see what is the relation we get with respect to theta it can be readily be seen from seen why the removal of the center portion of solid rod does not remove any considerable part of the torsional stiffness of the section so if the wall comes thin we have the section as shown where the portion of the membrane presenting the wall can be assumed to have a constant slope this particular portion so that tau may be equated with that slope value that tau is a so since from the equation t equals to twice the volume under the membrane what we can see that the volume under the membrane is this height and h a multiplied by h t twice a multiplied by h and t is equals to h by t as we can see this is the slope and then if we substitute the value of h here we get that t is equals to twice at taurefer slide time one thousand, one hundred and twenty-six so with that note we come to the relation as tau is equals to t by twice a t using the stress equations we find the angular twist for constant value of t and theta may be written as integration tau ds 2ga or this may be again from the relations whatever we have seen may be written as ts by a4a square g t so in this equation s is the perimeter of the cross section and a is the average area enclosed by the cross section wall the membrane method so membrane method clearly shows the great difference in torsional stiffness between a completely closed thin wall cylinder completely closed and thin wall cylinder and a cylinder that has been cut figure above these are the two examples we are considering now to discuss with membrane analogy and how the torsion torsional resistance varies that will try to discuss in the first cylinder the value of phi on the outer boundary is equal to zero but the value of phi on the inner boundary is some constant value different from zero this boundary so this is not equals to zero if we put some internal pressure so the membrane as we have discussed in the last slide membrane is something like this so that is the reason we have some definite value here since the resistance to a torsional moment is proportional to the volume v under the membrane here v one this resistance is indicated by the shaded area shown as v 1so we are supposed to find out this volume for this closed ring so what happens if it is not a closed ring refer slide time one thousand, three hundred and forty-seven so in case of cuttering considering now the cut cylinder we see that there is only one surface to this member there is one surface to this member and that phi equals to zero so this total edge if we look at starting from here to here it is a complete single edge and there phi is equals to zero on both the sides of the and outside of the board both inside and outside of the cylinder thus the volume representing the torque resistance is that of the small volume v two this volume this volume covering this area it is therefore quite apparent that even the smallest cut in such a member reduce its torsional stiffness to a point where it is essentially equal to the torsional stiffness of the thin plate with a thickness equal to the cylinder wall thickness and width equal to the perimeter of the cylinder so it is saying that if we stretch it it is becoming almost similar case a thin wall section and with that scenario the capability to resist torsion reduces in great way so that is what from the membrane analogy we can easily conclude and keeping in mind that analogy we also conclude that now if we are able to find out j effective separately for this sections which makes the c section a one is this one a two is this one and a three is this one then we can easily have summation of those j effectives to find out the j effective for the total c section thusfor any thin walled section open section it is approximately correct to say that the torsional stiffness is equal to the torsional stiffness of its elements considered as flat plate under torsion so with that concept it gives us some approximate method of analysis that helps a lot for the initial iteration and with that note we move to the next slide refer slide time one thousand, six hundred and nineteen we will try to find out solution for a very easy problem the equations for a long rectangular rectangle can easily be obtained by a consideration of the membrane analogy if in figure above h is very very greater than b in this figure is talked about the membrane can be considered a cylindrical surface one to mean if we look from this side this becomes something like this there will be changes definitely at this corner this corner this corner and this corner but we can easily neglect that part since we are going for the approximate analysis so that cylindrical surface we will get since the effects of the ends on the volume enclosed under the membrane will be very small as these corners as we said we can easily consider that that as a cylinder and if we do that for a cylindrical surface what is mentioned here this is the cylinder this cylinder is talked about for a cylindrical membrane loaded with a tension force s and a normal pressure p the deflection is given by delta equals to pb square by 8s this is a standard value what we are using we are not going to derive this nd the maximum slope is alpha equals to twice delta by b by two and which leads to pb by twice s refer slide time one thousand, eight hundred and thirteen so we the volume under the membrane is equal to v two third of b delta h and we have this value one by twelve pb k by h by s but since we have the relation p by s equals to 2g theta and t equals to twice v if we combine those two we get the equation t is equals to one third h b cube g theta and the tau max which is equals to alpha and if we substitute the values whatever we have observe here is equals to t by one third h b square and theta from the membranology theta or the rotation for unit length per unit length is given by t by one third h b cube g the effective polar moment of inertia j effective is equals to one third h b cube as it is obtained in this relation in is very small compared to the true polar moment of inertia of the section which is h b cube s h cube b divided by twelve so there is a big difference as the section becomes more thin it becomes less in value and as the it is less in value it shows more theta so in this connection we go further in the case discussed so far the equation of the membrane may be determined analytically in more general cases experimental methods may be used in which a whole shepherd like the cross section of the cylindrical bar to be considered is cut in the plate is so film or thin highly stretched rubber film is placed over the hole and then subjected to a known normal pressure the shape of the membrane surface is determined either by mechanical probes or by optical methodsif only relative values are wanted they may be obtained by using a circular hole with the same membrane and the same internal pressure since the value of the circle are known the value of the unknown cross section can be determined by comparison so with this note we come to the membrane analogy method and we come to the end of our course aircraft structures one refer slide time two thousand, one hundred and one refer slide time two thousand, one hundred and eleven and moving further we see the usual slide what consisting of the reference books and with this note we would like to say i would like to thank you for attending the course and hope it will help you a lot to understand the subject well and to move further in academic world as well as in thephysical design or engineering world whatever we call it and it will be helpful for your career thank you for attending the course thank you"}

aircraft structures one course m yself anup g hosh from aerospace engineering department iit kharagpur w e are in the last lecture of week one this is the fifth lecture i n this lecture we will cover the conceptual structural detail of a typical aircraft and we will continue further for more a nalysis in the forthcoming week so with this weeks lecture we will complete the intr oduction of aircraft structures how does it look like how the loads come to the aircraft and how does it internally look like what is the principle of fabrication and con struction of aircraft structures and with those things we will conclude but before we conclude or go forward for todays lecture what we have done this week in our last four lectures are as follows refer slide time one hundred and nine we have covered the historical background of aerospace structural analysis that is basically the history of solid mechanics starting from the experiment of leonardo da vinci to maybe koiter donnell shell theories in betwee n various others like bernoulli timoshenko hooke many others are there to contribute w e have learned the first flight and a brief history of aviation we have come across how big the structures are what dif ference do we have any difference between the construction of a hug e aircraft and a small aircraft we have seen there is no such difference in construction only size chang es according to the requirement definitely structural details and design changes depe nding on the configuration refer slide time three hundred and twenty-five in the last lecture we have seen various typ es of external loads encountered by an aircraft and today we will cover other concepts covering the principles of stress ed skin structure external loads again will com e basic structural components of an aircraft basically we will be giving stress today on this refer slide time three hundred and fifty-two so functions of stru ctural components if we look at those are basic aircraft structures t he basic functions of an aircraft structures are to transmit and resist the applied load t his is true as well for any structure so it is covered that way to provide an aerodynamic shape this is something important some nowadays in buildings als o it is followed to reduce drag but here it is having a different purpose that is the aerodynamic shape that is the important shape which provid es the lift and an aircraft fly to protect passengers payload systems etc from environmental conditi ons encountered during a flight t his is another very important thing a nything we put inside an aircraft that generally comes unless we cre ate some artificial pressurized cabin and air conditioned cabin it is supposed to experience probably minus fifty-five degree centigrade of temperature minus fifty-five degree centigrade of temperature is really a very cool envi ronment so we need to think about those while we design structure we need to think about all other avionics and other componen ts while we design those things not only that pressure also reduces so depending o n those environmental condition s we need to design the components or the structural components has to withstand those types of environmental loads and it also needs to protect the payloads say it is carrying passenger it needs to protect the passengers passengers cannot fly at minus fifty-five degree centigrade or minus six zero degree centigrade temperature so it has to be protected from that environment t he requir ements in most of the aircraft result ing in a shell structure the s hell cell structure is as i have said in our first lecture shell structure is something which is curved structure and say if i have a panel which is having some curvature and this thickness is small with respect to other two dimensions say this is a this is b and say if this is t so if t is very very small with respect to a and b we call that plate but while it has a curvature while it has a radius of curvature it is carved in nature we generally call that as a shell structure s o if we look at the aircraft structures most of the structures are shell structures s o we need to design those shell structures s o the outer surface of the skin of a shell is usually supported by longitudinal stiffening members and transvers e frames to enable it to resist so what is there inside w e have seen the photographs many times but we also need to see in more detail what is there inside t here are longitudinal stiffening members and there are transverse frames s o this is so me bulkhead in case of the fuselage this is ribs in case of the wing but all these structures as i said this transverse frame or the longitudinal stiffe ning members are supposed to encounter bending compression and torsional loads bending compression and torsional loads you are a lready introduced in your first year courses in your mechanics courses so i do not need to talk about much y ou are alread y also introduced with the buckling and we have intr oduced with the column buckling euler column f ormula already you have studied but here we need to consider buck ling of the plate as well as shells s o if this is the plate and there are forces like thi s this plate may buckle so we need to consider the buckling load of the skin and local buckling really creates a problem that is a very go verning criteria to design skin s uch structures are known as semi monocoque s o by such structures what do you wa nt to mean thus by such structures which you want to mean the structures which consist of these longitudinal stiffening members which consists of transverse frames are the structures kno wn as semi monocoque structures so as if we look at all aircraft s tructures nowaday s are semi monocoque structures while thin shells which rely entirely on their skin for their capacity to resist load are refe rred to as monocoque structures s o these structures whatever we have seen those are same monocoque structures a nd shell which rely entirely on skins for their capacity to resist loads are r eferred to as monocoque structures m onocoque structures are now adays not used okay so let us move to the next slide refer slide time one thousand and fifty-seven okay in this slide we will see the typical structural arrangement of a wing and that struc tural arrangement is drawn here in this structural arrangement whatever we see is this is the rib portion t his is already okay pointed out t his is the rib rib if we look at okay one portion is missing not missing it would not be visible but say rib is from here it is inside like that there are ribs also ins ide and if we look at this spar this spar continues this way with the spar flanges and this is the long itudinal stiffeners these are the stiffeners this also continues this is inside s o if we look at the wing structure there are many such stiffeners and to mention that this is not that easy structure as we see here because sometimes there are aileron here aileron comes this way this is the portion of the aileron w e need to separate it out from here t here are hinges which attach to it t he shape of the cross section is governed by the aerodynamic considerations and clearly must be maintain ed for all combination of loads so this shape the rib shape governs the shape of the rib if we look at this is the rib shape that is the airfoil section shape and that produces the lift we need to maintain that for every situation refer slide time one thousand, three hundred and forty-seven so again if we look at the wing rib construction that is to some extent more promine nt here how all those ribs come i f you notice a number of ribs increases here in the root section and it reduces at the tip sections t he interval between the consecutive rib is less on the tip sect ion whereas in the root section it is more and you can also notice that the basic construction detail of wing horizontal tailplane and vertical tailplane are similar so construction detail of this this and this is similar only size and oth er loads go vern the design okay refer slide time one thousand, four hundred and forty so the transverse frame or ribs more details on that s o these follow and maintain the aerodynamic shape t hey also act with the skin in resisting the distrib uted aerodynamic pressure loads whatever press ure loads come on the skin that get s transferred through the rib they d istribute any concentrated load for example undercarriage load additional wing store loads s o if w e go back to the previous slide we will see that in this particular case there i s no undercarriage load additional wing store loads are also not there but in case of military aircraft or say an agricultural aircraft needs to carry additional store load about the undercarriage load while the landing gear is attached to the wing that time it requires to carry those to the structure and distribute this a ll these loads are carried to the structure and redistribute stresses around discontinuities s o redistribution of stresses around discontinuities is another impor tant part ribs increase the column buckling stress of longitudinal stiffeners by providing end restraint establishing or reducing the column length s o if we look at this if we increase the number of ribs the panel size here is this much whereas panel s ize in the root se ction is this here also it is big the skin panel it is big s o this reduces or increases the size of the panel thereby it enhances the buckling property of the skin so buckling stresses of the longitudinal stiffeners by end restraint so it provides end restraints establishing or reducing their column length s o this is not only for skin as i told you if we look at the stiffeners these stiffener s also are attached to the skin so that length here column is some memb er which carries the axial load this length is reduced with a number of ribs in a similar manner they increase the plate buc kling stress of the skin panels plate or shell buckling stress of the skin panels so the ribs not only distribute loads coming fr om the undercarriage from wing store not only provides the aerodynamic shape it also enhances the capability of the other members like as it is said the plate and shell buckling parameter it enhances i t also enhances the column length of the stiffeners so ribs have various pr operti es and it serves that way refer slide time one thousand, eight hundred and sixteen so this is one two views of an aircraft to have a better understanding a s i told you this undercarriage load is coming directly to the wing and number of ri bs required here are more where ver the engi ne is attached that portion als o has to be designed those ribs a number of ribs here are more where as the number of ribs probabl y are less on the wing tip side so depending on those things this view assists us to know where and how the ribs are used refer slide time one thousand, eight hundred and fifty-six more on ribs let us see t he out er portion of the wing ribs in the outer portion of the wing ribs act primarily as formers for the airfoil shape since it is a low load carrying section a s i told you in the previous slide there the interval between th e consecutive ribs it is much or density is low i t only maintains the shape and extremely lightweight structur e is sufficient for the purpose so that is the reason for the weight reduc tion number of ribs are reduced near or the root section ribs are required to absorb and transmit large concentrated applied loads where from the large concentrated applied loads come from the undercarriage as well as from engine as well as stores s o wing stores means if we look at if a military aircraft is carrying some warhead on the wing that is known as a store deployable stores s o those while it is carrying it that there must be some provisions to carry the load that provision is taken care of by the ribs from the undercarriage engine thrust fuselage attachment points reactions etc in the middle of the wing ribs suppo rt hinge reactions from aileron flaps and other control surfaces s o midportion it is important for attaching the control surfaces i f we go back to the previous slide if we l ook at various control surfaces these are al l leading edge control surfaces trailing edge control surfaces all these control surfaces ha ve to be attached to the wing very efficient manner and that requires a lot of arrangement inside the wing an d those are done refer slide time two thousand, one hundred and seven wing skins if we look at it is an impermeable surface for supporting the ae rodynamic pressure distribution f rom t here the wing lift is generated these aerodynamic forces are transmitted to the ribs and stif feners by the skin so it is to transfer the loads to the ribs as well as to the stiffeners through plate and membrane action s hear and torsional loads are carried by the skin and spar webs while axial and bending loads are reacted by the combined acti on of the skin and longitudinal stiffeners longitudinal stiffeners if you talk about this is what the longitudinal stiffener is these are attached to the skin and ribs there by dividing the skin into small panels and increasing the buckling and failing s tress of t he skin s o these longitudinal stiffeners act to reduce the effective leng th of panels as well as columns refer slide time two thousand, two hundred and thirty-one spar webs this is what the spar web is t his portion is the spar web t hese r esist shear and torsional loads and they perform a secondary but significant function in stabilization with the skin spar flanges the spar flanges is this t his is generally consisting of three sections from this view if you look at and there are rivets s o this portion is know n as the flange as you see here spar flanges or caps are capable of sup porting large comp ressive loads so while the wing is deflecting say this is the wing if it is deflecting this way while flying or while taxiing due to the other loads it is this way so this portio n will act to encounter compressive loads from axial and bending effects so above mentioned structural fun ctions are applicable for wings horizontal and vertical tail planes s o all these description s whatever we have done these are applicable equally for horizon tal and vertical tails okay refer slide time two thousand, three hundred and fifty-nine this slide gives us some introduction to t he nomenclature or the portions so quickly we will go through t his is radome static port on both sides pitot tubes on both sides here also static ports are there t his is engine intake th is is wing tip portion aileron is this trailing edge flaps auxiliary power unit inlet this is also an auxiliary power unit outlet this is an elevator horizontal stabilizer rudder vertical stabilizer upper fu selage spoilers wing upper surface leadi ng edge slats angle of airflow sensors refer slide time two thousand, four hundred and forty-seven if we come to the fuselage aerodynamic forces on this fuselage skin are relatively low t his generally protect s the cargo as well as this is the cargo hold where this is the place where passengers seat in case of cargo aircraft all this portion is converted for carrying cargo fuselage supports large concentrat ed loads such as wing reactions s o total lift comes to the fuselage in a wing fuselag e junctions those wing reactions it has to carry tailplane reactions for pitching moment whatever pitching moment is coming from the horizontal tail plane that is carried by the fuselage undercarriage reactions and carries a paylo ad of different size a nd weight whatever undercarriage reaction comes whenever it is within the fuselage it is for a cargo aircraft whatever we have seen an225 all those landing gears were attached to the fuselage it was not on the wing like the previous schematic diagram we have seen i n the last slid which may cause large inertia forces because of the hu ge mass carried by the fuselage it will definitely create inertia forces and the aircraft design for high altitude flight must withstand internal pressure this is anoth er important thing internal pressure i nternal pressure is something which it has to be there to fly at that high altitude eleven kilometer from our surface at minus fifty-five degree or low pressure the most efficient sectional shape of the pressurized fuselage is circular but it is not limited to circular it sometimes come s as elliptical surface also or a c ombination of circular elements refer slide time two thousand, seven hundred and thirteen some more details of the fuselage the b asic fuselage structure is essentially a single cell thinwalled t ube t his is what the thin wall outside wall is there that is the fuselage thin single cell comprises of skin that outside skin transverse frame these are the frames if i say this is the frame her e transverse frame one two three four like th at there are many frames inside stiffeners these are the stiffeners there are many that reduce the effective length of the skin this is the skin actually the buckling of the skin is prevented by reducing the effective length by stiffeners as well as bulkheads longit udinal stiffeners t he transverse members in the fuselage are termed as rings or frames or if they extend across the comp lete cross section as bulkheads s o depending on that type of things it is e ither ring or frame or bulkhead refer slide time two thousand, eight hundred and thirty-eight some more detail about the spar p resent days the aircraft s have a wing loading of about four thousand, eight hundred newton per meter square and the structural weight is around twenty-two to twenty-five s o construction is really very important and efficient f abric ation is indeed a difficult job so if we look at it the spar this is the junction inside or in some cases inside the fuselage in some cases this junction is not present in small aircraft this type of junctions is present inside the aircraft if we look at a cross section as i wa s drawing in the previous slide this is the stiffener this is the same stiffener we will see that is attached there with these rivets these are the rivets and t his is the spar flange portions i t changes from one section to the ot her and it continues to the tip s o this is the fuselage if we look at and this continues up to the tip if any winglet is there something may be something like this refer slide time three thousand and seventeen this is further detail of the rib section t his is really consisting of many parts this is the spar what we have seen the last slide and this is the portion created for passing the spar flange this cutout in the rib this is the cutout this is actually a cutout in the rib through which th e stiffener passes for the skin all these z sec tions are stiffeners w e usually put more number of holes depending upon the requirement there are two rings because the holes are stiffened the edges that reduce the weight and not only that these holes are req uired for passing control wires control rods as well as for fuel tanks different ot her purposes the holes are used these are the reef stiffener since the section size is increasing to stiffen this portion these inbetween stiffeners are used t his portion is curved because there are control s urfaces will come here so all these things a typical wing rim assembly refer slide time three thousand, one hundred and fifty-seven so with this we come to th e conclusion of todays lecture maybe this weeks lecture all these are the standard references where from al l these details a re taken d etails are taken from bruhn details are taken from megson and many other books refer slide time three thousand, two hundred and eighteen so at the end we conclude that thin lightweight metallic or laminated composites with high specific stiffness a re used for aircraft stru ctures i n general two types of loads are exper ienced by an aircraft structure aerodynamic load and ground load b asics of wing and fuselage constructions we have seen which is co mmon for all types of aircrafts n ame and functions of basic structural parts of an airc raft we have seen construction details of the wing rib and spar we have seen so with this let us end todays lecture and we will go forward further for analysis in the coming week t hank yo u for attending todays lecture we will meet again in o ur next"}
{"audio_filepath": "/media/rishu/Data1/Code Playground/test_ai4b/wav/6.wav", "duration": 2512.59, "text": "lecture no six airworthiness of a n aircraft welco me back to aircraft structures one course this is anup ghosh from aer ospace engineering department iit kharagpur this is the first lecture of the second week we will learn about airworthiness of an aircraft so before we go into the topic in detail today we will let us see what we have covered refer slide t ime fifty-three so far we have covered so far historical background of aerospace structural analysis development of aircraft the first point if we look at first point is basically the history of solid mechanics we have seen and that is what leads the path for analysis of structures and then in the next lecture we have covered development of aircraft since seventeen december one thousand, nine hundred and three from the kitty hawk flight till date whatever we have seen and then where how what of aircraft with respect to size and configuration we have seen v arious sizes from small to big and but we have also observed that from structures point of view there is not much change but according to configuration we need to have some change in the structural design various types of external loads you have seen wher e from the exter nal loads come how does it come the loads are the basic thing which we need to withstand so loads will come in our discussion again and again today also we will discuss about loads so that was an introduction to the external loads and we will do more detail about loads conceptual structural detail of a typical aircraft in this we have a seen in articulated fashion what is there inside a wing what is there fuselage how does it look like what are the structural components called and all tho se things nomenclatures all those things we have already covered refer slide t ime two hundred and forty-four and in today\u2019s lecture what we will do we will cover the airworthiness will cover load factor source of different loads flight maneuvers and loading conditions so flight according to flight maneuvers how the loading condition changes that we will see so let us have some before we go to the airworthiness refer slide t ime three hundred and ten let us see some basic considerations on loads again if we look at this slide the load conditions govern the dimensions of a member that is always true under load we generally change the dimension we need to change the material we need to because we need to withstand the load it has to support the load to serve its purpose external lo ads encountered while in flight and in the ground in general in aircraft in two tier in these are the two conditions in flight and in the ground with different types o f loads come in ground towing wasting pulling all those loads come even taxing or those loa d in during flight different maneuver loads will generally come so all those things we need to encounter instead of looking for all load condition aircraft components are designed for critical load conditions for each and every structural member so this is important critical load conditions see previous ly also we have discussed different loading conditions and the picture if we look at this picture we see that there are different load s indicated and those loads are on which it is designed the aircraft an d which for those loads which section is more vulnerable that is indicated there but here the critical load condition that we need to find out and those critical load condition s are specified by licensing agencies licensing agencies mean there are agenc ies who certifies the design who certifies the fabrication who certifies the flight testing so th ese licensing agencies certifies everything then only it is allowed to fly that is the reason flight is so safe than any other journey so depending on the past investigation and experience so the licensing agencies improve their experience they are critical conditions load conditions and accordingly we continue for design refer slide t ime five hundred and forty-five so let us come back to the topic of airworthiness wh ere from it comes if you look a discussion here a kind of definition the airworthiness of an aircraft is concerned with the standards of safety incorporated in all aspects of its construction it is concerned about the safety incorporation while it is being constructed while it is being designed in all cases this range from structural strength to the provision of certain safeguards in the event of a crash landing and include design requirement relating the aerodynamics performance and electrical and hydraulic s ystems so it looks into everything it looks into the overall design of aircraft in with respect to aerodynamics with respect to electrical and hydraulic design every aspect but from our point of view we will be considering we will be looking into the a irworthiness requirements in our structural point of view a brief is all given here in a diagram form we define that capability of an aircraft to perform such satisfactorily the airworthiness actually looks into the safety capability of an aircraft to perform satisfactorily with safety how does it perform satisfactorily that is the aim of airworthiness criteria to fulfill mission requirements every flight has a mission requirement in civil aviation as a mission requirement to carry passengers from one airport to the other like that mission requirements varies recent days we see lot of jungle fires or forest fires are coming up for that there are specific aircrafts to fight those so that remains requirement of that particular mission is to fight again st the fire like that there are agricultural aircrafts the agricultural aircrafts mission is in general is to spray required amount of maybe pesticide may be nutrients to the field like th at depending on the mission it as different type of requirements or say a fighter aircraft has a different type of requirement so all those requirements depending on the requ irements generally airworthiness criteria come and accordingly it has to be satisfied throughout the specified life this is another important thing this is not only to satisfy the requirement whether it is able to satisfy it throughout the life that is also important so it tries to ensure that it needs to be tested after certain flight hour all those requirements are spec ified in these safety guidel ine in a defined envelope so that is what we were discussing this defined envelope some of you probably have some idea what is envelope flight envelope but if you do not have any idea of flight envelope means how much force how long it can fly all those t hings are defined in a flight envelope whether how much g load it can sustain how much angle of attack it can sustain all those things are defined by this flight envelope whether how much roll or pitching rate it can achieve all those things are defined here with acceptable level of safety a nd reliability so this governing with respect to these points the airworthiness defines the criteria and we need to follow it so for structural point of view let us see how these things come into our consideration refer slide t ime one thousand and three airworthiness requirement in case of structures handbook of official requirement s with mention of minimum standar ds of safety incorporated in all aspects of its constructions structural strength safeguards in case of crash landi ng design requirement relating to the aerodynamic performance electrical and hydraulic systems limit load so this is something new we have not discussed a limit load is the maximum load that the aircraft is expected to experience in normal operation proof load is the product of the limit load and the proof factor which generally ranges in between one to one hundred and twenty-five and ultimate load is the product of the limit load and the ultimate factor that is usually fifteen so generally we find out depending on the flight envelo pe depending on the performance we find out the limit load and then with respect to whatever we need to find out proof load or the limit load we generally find i t out and accordingly we do t hese the aircraft structure must withstand the proof load without detrimental distortion and should not fail until the ultimate load has been achieved and this is where the proof load comes in united kingdom has a different guideline for airworthiness that is ap nine hundred and seventy for military and dcar for civil aircraft s usa h as its own guideline that is f ar for civil and mil for military aircraft like that almost all countries have their own guidelines these two countries come first because they initiated it first refer slide t ime one thousand, two hundred and twenty-nine so if we so airworthiness agencies are there in all countries here is the small list of airworthiness agencies in usa in uk already we have said and which organization acts to implement those regulations are listed on the right hand side table right hand side column so in case of usa federal aviation requirements or federal aviation agency washington is the responsible agency for the civil aircraft and department of defense and military specifications sorry for in uk civil aviation authority caa in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-two became air registration board uses bri tish civil aviation regulation mod procurement executive def stan00 nine hundred and seventy is the military aircraft organization like that similarly we have different organization for france we have different organization for germany we have different organizations for ru ssia like that we have different organization in india also aircraft act one thousand, nine hundred and thirty-four director general of civil aviation more popularly known as dgca is the agency which governs everything if he were aware of the recent development dgca has come out with some r egulation with respect to the small uav\u2019s like that they time to time improve their guidelines they revise their guidelines and design requirements implement those regulations like that for military aircraft design approvals cemilac is the organization qu ality and assurance dgaqa is the organization for design approval the cemilac is the organization who approves the d esign like the lca aircraft light combat aircraft or the alh advanced light helicopter what we have already developed our country have alr eady developed so in that case the cemilac is the organization who approves the design and for quality and other dgaqa is the organization who takes care of this refer slide t ime one thousand, five hundred and twenty so okay we are more to the requirement with respect to the struc tures so with respect to the struct ures has we have seen where from the load comes how those load come to the aircraft those are some of the important points why we think of designing of aircraft we need to think where from it may come so that is the rea son this table groups different sources of aircraft load so if we look at the sources first is the air load then during landing then other loads are definitely we will come other loads include other loads category inertia land category takeoff taxing power plant so let us start with the air load maneuver is the certain type of movement of aircraft due to which what are the types of load comes it may come to mind if to move what are the load structure may experience actually for different change of acc eleration different type of loads inertia loads comes to aircraft and that becomes a predominant criteria for design during gust or the sudden change of wind velocity and direction that creates a sudden again finally it gives the change of acceleration an d that gets creates inertia load not only that sometimes it leads to the sudden loss of lift and if it losses the lift suddenly it acts like and impact to the total aircraft control deflection for maneuvering for certain direction change we always need to have a control deflection and that control deflection induces loa d and that load we need to take care component interaction different components interact this is very interesting criteria we say different components interact means it is difficult with the understanding you have to describe now component interaction may be the highest example we may say the fluttering or maybe interaction between a controls two different controls surfaces now we go to the buffeting is a certain type of aerodynamics phen omena due to which a periodic oscillation comes and that is experienced generally by the tail plane and that has to be taken care during landing vertical load factor we will work out this thing in our in some example later on spin up if it spins up that means after touching down if it spins up sorry it is not that it is the spin up of the wheel springing back it is also related to the spinning back of the wheel that it produces inertia c rabbed landing this is very important things there are in many vide os available in internet you may look at it crab bed landing is very interesting and really a beautiful example of how the control system has developed in case of aircraft control so while in aircraft lands with angular fashion in an airport so that is wh at the crab bed landing is and then one wheel sometimes during crab bed landing or some other condition also one wheel touches down and that creates huge impact that that has to be taken care arrested landing and breaking these are two special cases arrested landing is that in case of aircraft carrier lan ding they are arresting hooks are there and that arrest the landing will solve example with respect to this other landing loads coming from the towing we need tow an aircraft we need to jack an aircraft pressurization the fuselage is pressurized bird strike this is very bad un wanted incidents but we need to take care of it unfortunately bird strike and we need to have a safe design for that actuation of different control surfaces and crash which is not at al l a desired condition but we need to have some kind of safety for crash so inertia loads due to acceleration as i told you all this maneuvers also finally goes to the acceleration change of acceleration but this is a inertia load talks about a regulatio n acceleration of the aircraft rotation regular rotation dynamics load because of the various other dynamics criteria involved in during flight vibration and flatter all these things in introduces the inertia loads and that those loads we need to talk ab out during takeoff catapult take off like the arrested landing in carriers aircraft carriers we need to have catapult takeoff system and t hat catapult is generally attack ed to some fuselage junction so those has to be designed properly aborted takeoff i f it is for some reason aborted what are the forces come and when it is getting aborted all those things we need to take care bumps and turning these are as i told you dur ing taxing the aircraft is full of fuel even a small bump creates a huge load on the wing fuselage junction power plant from their only the total thrust comes and that gets transferred to the wing and to the total air craft for partial failure it creates a huge torque to the total system it also creates gyroscopic effect because of it i s rotation vibration due to its own source of vibration duct pressure is another source of loads we from the power plant we need to take care refer slide ti me two thousand, two hundred and thirty-six okay this is a kind of a repetition slide from the previous one this slide let us sk ip refer slide t ime two thousand, two hundred and forty-six so this is very important slide this is phenomena is very important as i was discussing that the flight envelope is the important thing so what is flight envelop in one sense this is flight angle of what is this is let us t ry to learn this is a plot of n the load factor with respect to the v various loading conditions for an airplane are usually represented on a graph of a limit load factor n plotted against the indicated airs peed v this diagram is often called v n diagr am or a flight envelope or a v n diagram v g diagram sorry since the load factor n is related to that acceleration of the gravity g it justifies this now let us see how this diagram is developed and why do we need to have this diagram for different type of aircraft this flight and envelope is fixed say for a civil aviation generally this n values maximum values are fixed in minimum values are fixed and v max is also fixed so all this things are fixed so these things are generally this part of the plot i s generally found out from the hi gh positive high angle of attack and these portion low positive low angle of attack from here to here and whenever there the limit of speed air speed comes their it comes suddenly down we should not cross that and that cros sing may lead to some other failure other problems different values of n and this portion is generally governed by the negative low angle of attack and this is again this actually this total portion is not very intentional portion for a certain desired m anoeuver but this portion is generally encountered negative lower angle of attack negative high angle of attack so these two portion s are generally during the stall it happens and it is generally kept as the value one hundred and twenty-five times the general va lue obtain for n and in case of negative we generally do not compromise we do not keep margin that of twenty-five so let us see how do we do considering situation in which a manoeuver is undertaken such that the angle of incident is increased to a value corresponding to the maxi mum lift coefficient that is cl max that can be obtained lift force will be so this is a formula we need to memorize now lift force is half rho v square cl max and s what is rho rho is the density of air v is the velocity of the aircraft here it is mix ed actually this is airspeed so this is the air speed and then cl max is the maximum lift coefficient and s is the surface area of v so n this is the definition of n if we say n lift w so if lift is this whatever we have said this becomes something w comes in the denominator so that is what is given here you see only instead of cl max here it has been said as cz max that actually is the component which is considered for indetermination not the lift in the direction of z what is the coefficient lif t in the direction upward what is the coefficient that and one hundred and twenty-five that so this is the highest point curve it should be maintained that means it is having a high angle of attack slowly while it is increasing the velocity the n value increases and there is a limit up to which it can increase this portion is called the stall portion and this is positive stall and this is the negative stall portion refer slide t ime two thousand, eight hundred and ten typical values of limit load factors these are some from the guidelines available so for general aviation normally it is twenty-five to thirty-eight for n negative is one to fifteen for general aviation utility aircraft it is little bit more in positive that is forty-four general aviation aerobatic it is six it needs to go for a different type of maneuver and that man euver needs a high g requirement and we need to follow that and negative also it does because some times for aerobatic reasons its flies even inverted so home build aircrafts are generally allowed up to 5g and in negative 2g for transport aircraft it is three to 4g and one to 2g strategic bombers that is three is the general limit one like that for tactical bomber we have some limits for fighter aircrafts this is also very high like the aerobatic aircraft because it needs to go through different type of maneuver s critical maneuvers to fight refer slide t ime two thousand, nine hundred and forty-nine the limit loads used by civil agencies are applied loads used by military agencies are the maximum anticipated loads in the inter service life span of the vehicle the ultimate loads commonly referr ed to the design loads refer to as the design loads are the limit load multiplied by a factor of safety as an example for a military aircraft the limit loads on the wing occurs during a eight g maneuver we with factor of fifteen of the design load for aircraft wi ng becomes twelve g so for an military aircraft eight g becomes twelve g with a factor of safety fifteen for missile structure the factor of safety is one hundred and twenty-five for other aircraft structure the factor of safety is fifteen so lim it load and ultimate loads are two loads which we ne ed to find out limit load is the load experienced and ultimate load is with factor of safety what we used for design refer slide t ime three thousand, one hundred and thirty-three okay so this is some typical conditions at different angle of attack for design purpose what we have seen in t he flight envelope so if you look at the positive high angle of attack condition it is obtained in a pull out at the highest possible angle of attack on the wing the positive high angle of attack condition will be critical for compressive stresses in the upper forward region of the wing upper forward region of the wing across section and for tensile stresses in the lower aft region of the wing that is this portion now if we understand try to understand one others also will be much easier if we try to h igh angle of attack as i told you it happens in general during positive stall so if we look at an to an aircraft with a line diagram if we say this is starboard and this is port side and if we look at this section as this section at the tip what is happen ing for positive high angle of attack actually the air fall is something like this not only this because of positive high angle of attack if we look at this if this is the fuselage and if this is the wing it deflects like this so what is happen at rout e this portion definitely the top portion is definitely under compression and the bottom portion is definitely under tension because it is deflecting this way now it says that highest possible angle of attack on the positive high angle of attack condition will be critical for compressive stresses in the upper forward region why it is saying the upper forward region will be more critical because with respect to the fuselage this angle is not same throughout the along the wing s o because of that they are always will be some moment acting this way and that will increase the compression on this region more in comparison to this region and similarly since it is deflecting in this manner that will equally increase tension in this region that is the region it says for positive high angle of attack condition it is obtained this is why when do we get in case of pullout maneuver we get it the highest possible angle of attack on the wing in the upper forward section the positive high angle of attack condition wi ll be critical for compressive stresses in upper forwa rd region of the wing across section and for tensile stresses in the lower act region of the wing across section so accordingly as we have just now discussed because of this two three dimensio nal phenomen a the port side trailing tip if we look at it will reflect something like this way and we will have to will we can easily understand why compression is more important in this region why the maximum tension is more important in this region so let us go furt her for other condition and cases refer slide t ime three thousand, seven hundred and sixteen so this is another positive low angle of attack during generally cruise condition it happens the wing has the smallest possible angle of attack at which lift corresponding to the limit load fa ctor may be developed the wing bending moment in this condition produces the maximum compressive stress on the upper rear flange and adjacent strin ger and maximum tensile stresses on the lower front spar flanges and adjacent stringers so this time the m ost important portions sections are those for compressi on and this for tensile see it is similar but since the it is not high angle of attack that is the reason the this section does not remain so important whereas this section becomes more important for design so similarly but the phenomena remains almost same only thing it may happen that what we have seen since it is low angle of attack probably the angle of attack we absorbed may be something like this and this will definitely not produce much load on this region whereas it will produce much load compressive load in this region refer slide t ime three thousand, eight hundred and fifty-two similar manner we may see other two important conditions that is negative high angle of attack condition it occurs in intentional flight maneuvers as i were discussing in which the air loads on the wing are down or when the airplane strikes sudden downdraft s while on flight the wing bending moment in the negative high angle of attack condition produce the highest compressive stresses in the lower fo rward region of the wing cross section and the highest tensile stresses in the upper aft region of the wing cross section so similar way if we consider this as the poor side tip of the wing what will happen it will happen that there will be a huge mom ent like this and it will be something like this refer slide t ime four thousand and four so similar way we can see that incase of the last possible case that is negative low angle of attack these are the two regions tension are important this region this and these are important it occurs at the diving speed limit of the airplane t his condition may occur in an international sorry intentional maneuver producing a negative load factor or in a negative gust condition the compressive bending stresses have a maximum value i n the lower act region of the wing cross section and the tensile bending stresses have a maximum value in the upper forward region of the wing cross sections so with respect to the flight maneuver and different condition with respect to the load factor flight envelope we now have a certain idea how which section the critical condition occurs and we need to continue our design procedure or fixing dimensions of different section to with stand the load we do refer slide time four thousand, one hundred and sixteen references are stand ard it is always a mixed not that always all the books are put into but many time more than one books are consulted and prepared the notice prepared refer slide t ime four thousand, one hundred and thirty-two following that if we go to the conclusions slide from this lecture today what we have done the typical loading condition governing design of aircraft parts we have learned what is airworthiness we have got some fair idea about it what is load factor so stress of different loads flight maneuvers and loading conditions how in case of d ifferent flight maneuvers different loading conditions appear and with that let me conclude today\u2019s lecture this lecture thank you will meet again with our next lecture"}
{"audio_filepath": "/media/rishu/Data1/Code Playground/test_ai4b/wav/7.wav", "duration": 2195.73, "text": "lecture no seven aerodynamic loads and load factors welcome back to aircraft structures one course this is professor anup ghosh from aerospace engineer ing iit kharagpur this is the seventh lecture in the series in this lecture what we will cover is aerodynamics loads and load factor refer slide time forty-seven so what are the conc epts we will be covering is flight vehicle aerodynamic loads that is not in details it is a very small brief or maybe we must say in a very brief way how the load comes and then the calculation of load factor at different flight conditions how do we calculate it one example and then we will see t he bending moment an d shear force calculation for with some example of an aircraft but before we go into those it is with better to have a recapitulation in the recapitulation we can say that we have already learned in our previous lecture that what is flight envelope is and how does that flight envelope govern the design of an aircraft how air worthiness criteria and regulations come and we need to follow those and how we need to take care of all those requirements and previous to tha t we have learne d in various way how different loads are encountered by an aircraft and we have also learned the history of aviation history of aircraft we have also had look in into the history of solid mechanics which actually lays the path of structural analysis wi th respect to aircraft structures so let us start today \u2019s class with a note of aerodynamic loads and then a few examples or consideration s to calculate load factors and bending moment shear forces refer slide time two hundred and forty so if we see flight vehicle a erodynamic loads if we think of finding out how the load comes in it is the simplified approach we will be following as we have seen that we have denoted that c coefficient here as cz so we are not worried about in which exact direction the is acting but we are talking about the component of it which is acting in the z direction we are also talking about the component as cx so let us see what are the things we do after reading out this small description we will see generally the thrust line is con sidered as the axis the first aerodynamic data required for the structural analysis are the lift drag and pitching moment so unless we have these data we cannot design any aircraft so then on that the load factor or the flight envelope gives us the maxi mum load that is we need to multiply by in unless we have the lift we cannot find out the maximum lift or design lift or ultimate lift we nee d to find out drag we need to pitching moment we need to prepare this curve with respect to the alpha or angl e of attack for the complete airplane with horizontal tail plane removed this is important this is the general criteria generally the structural design starts through the r ange of angle of attack from negative stalling angle to the positive stall angle negative stalling angle and positive stalling angle alread y you have talked about stall angle stalling is the phenomena when aircraft los ses its lift probably you are already introduced to it negative and positive is that while it is in positive angle of attack or while it is in negative angle of attack wind tunnel test of a model aircraft with the h orizontal tail plan removed will provide values of the lift drag and pitching moment for all angles of attack components of the lift and drag with respect to airplane reference axe s are then obtained the airplane reference axes are usually chosen parallel and perpendicular to the thrust line as shown by the x and z axis that is what i mention in a brief the thrust line this line is the thrust line which is generally consider as x and perpendicular to that is the z axis the forces along the axes czqs and cx qs where q is the dynamic pressure equals to half rho v square and s is the wing area so two force coming from the lift is this is the total force czqs in vertical direction and in the horizontal direction is this much refer slide time sixty-one one now what do we do we have that cz curve and cx curve from experiment and now it is probably before the experiment numerical studies are done and similar conditi on we find out those data we simulate and find out those data here our angl e of attack alpha is t heta i is the incidence angle and theta is the thrust angle with the flight path and definitely a simple with respective to this diagram if yo u see this we get the cz as cl cos theta cd sin theta and cx as cx cos theta cl sin theta where cl a nd cd are the coefficient of lift and drag without the tail plane similarly cx and c z are the excuse me cx and cz are the non dimensional force coefficient without the tail plane the pitch ing moment about the airplane c g is obtained from wind tunnel data which is m generally given as that cm alpha c bar qs cm alpha is the dimensionless pitching moment coefficient of the airplane without tail plane and c bar is the main aerodynamic chord so this data we need to need for our structural design we generally many times refer to this for this reason these parameters are shown here to some extended explained and we will see how this data will use for our structural purpo se refer slide time eight hundred and two ok those who have found out but there is something more for different flight condition there is a contribution of the tale of how the balancing tail load comes so balancing tail load comes this way as we learn balancing tail load on the horizontal tail ctqs is obtained from the assumption that there is no angular acceleration on the airplane so there is nothing like no angular acceleration and no pitching movement is there or pitching acceleration is there ct is a dimensi onless tail fo rce coefficient expressed in terms of wing area and lt please note expressed in terms of wing area and lt what is lt lt is distance from the cg to the point reference point in the tail plane so due to various pressure load and horizontal lt is the distance from the airplane center of gravity to the resultant load on the horizontal tail plane due to the variation of pressure load on horizontal tail plane lt theoretically varies for different loading condition lt\u2019s varies but anyway we m ay consider this as fix and we may start our calculation so moment of the forces about the center of gravity are in equilibrium so that is what with respect to this point the mom ent is considered so with cm alpha c bar qs that is this one is equals to ctqslt and that is what is done and then from there ct is equal to c bar cm is divided by lt and the aerodynamic force on the aircraft in the z direction comes a s the sum of these both these two forces which is a equals to sci ssors z we considered as cz ct refer slide time one thousand and forty-one flight vehicle inertia loads this i was bringing in repeatedly in our previous discussion let us see in a methodical way what it is how it is comes and will let us solve a few example with that the maximum load on any part of a flight vehicle structure occurs when the vehicle is being accelerated the acceleration may be forward may be upward so let us see how this acceleration may come with example will learn the loads produced by landing impact manufacturing gusts bo ost and staging operations launching and docking are always greater than the loads occurring when all the forces on the vehicle are in equilibrium so whenever there is a sudden change there is the maximum load encountered by an aircraft that is what is s aid that is learning impact manufacturing gusts and boost gusts boost and staging launching and docking all these things before any structural component can be designed it is necessary to determine the inertial forces acting on the vehicle so we ne ed to find out that is what it says the inertia l forces and in general in three dimensional point of view we have defined the inertial forces in this form but for simplicity we will solve problem in a separate manner not in three dimensional form three dimensional f orm is really bit complicated will learn later refer slide time one thousand, two hundred and forty-two so load factor for translational acceleration for flight landing conditions in which the vehicles for flight landing conditions in which the vehicle has only translational accelerat ion every part of the vehicle is acted on by parallel inertial forces which are proportional to the weight of the part so this is a very good example we always see while we experience the breaking of a car that is what we all have experience what happ ens we fetch we go forward or for a sudden acceleration what happens we push more pressure on the back of the chair so that is because of our body inertia we are pushing it back and there is a hinge at in our wrist so that is what it is either pushes back while it accelerates or we come forward while it decelerates but that is a visible movement our muscle system accommodates that is very slowly it is not that slowly happens in all other structures in case of aircraft this is very predominant because c hange of velocity is huge in range it is not like a car where the in general it varies from ten twenty thirty kilometer maybe within two or three seconds so it becomes more in case of flight vehicles or aircrafts so that is what is discussed here when vehicle is be ing accelerated upward this that is the condition we will be considering now one point let us consider very carefully that it is accelerat ing upward this is what up these direction it is ac ting now which way the inertia force is acting this is the mas s w g multip lied a this comes from the d\u2019 alembert\u2019s principle in the opposite direction so if it goes up the in a positive acce lerati on in the goes up it acts in the opposite direction of it so that is what the inertia load acts on the system let n t he load factor and from the load factor definition whatever we know that l nw and that is wha t is equated with w w ag so lift has to balance both these forces that is what lift is w w ag and that is equated with nw and we get the n and in a v ery simple algebraic way we get that n one ag for downward acceleration what happens the inertia acts upward and sinc e the inertial is acting upward this is negative and it is beco ming one ag n is defined as the number of g\u2019s of acceleration in the v ertical direction for straight and level flight n one there is no acceleration we say level flight aircraft model in wind tunnel is also one it is equivalent to the level flight aircraft standing on the ground is also equals to one so these are the three typ ical condition where what we generally encounter refer slide time one thousand, seven hundred and twenty-six ok when the flight vehicle has horizontal acceleration this i s the case we see we have since it is going this way accelerating is this way ax component so the a w ax g is the in ertia force acting following the d\u2019 alembert\u2019s principle and that is what is equated in this equat ion it is very easy n w n w g multiplies by ax which is equals to thrust minus drag drag is not shown here actually drag is acting in these direction so what we do we get from the balance of this is that w ax g t d and nx t d w so a more general case if we look at while it is in a different condi tion and this is the z axis this is the thrust line this is x axis this is z axis w is acting this way and if we look at the component this is the component in the z direction is the acceleration acting assuming that it is moving upward so the dummy force inertial force following the alembert\u2019s principle is acting this way and one more component is acting in this direction so in the z direction if you consider the lift is definitely is balancing the component of it so this is balances as w co s theta plus this amount w az g and if you consider summation of forces in the z direction which lead s to that nw is equals to this amount and n is equals to this nz az g cos theta in the x direction if you look at we have a similar equati on t and d is here indicated t is acting this way dz is acting this way and we finally get nx equals to the sam e equation what we have here refer slide time two thousand and forty-four in the case of aircraft landing the landing load factor is defined as the vertical ground reaction divided by the aircraft weight this is what the ground reaction whatever we get please note that inertia force is acting downward the load factor in the horizontal direction is similarly defined as the horizontal ground reaction divided by the aircraft weight so what ever the rx value is that is divided by the weight shown nz is this one and nx is co rresponding to this one so if you example of different conditions and how do we find out the load factor we have covered and let us try to solve a few examples one or two examples refer slide time two thousand, two hundred and ten example one when loading on an aircraft carrier sorr y when landing on an aircraft carrier a five thousand kg aircraft is given a deceleration of 3g by means of a cable engaged by an arresting hook as shown here cable is not shown but the tension by the cable is shown here this is the tension by the cable and it is given a 3g deceleration weight of the aircraft is five thousand kg so let us see what are the thin gs we are supposed to find out find the tension in the cable s o t what is t t hat is first question the wheel reaction r this is the second question the distance e this distance e from c g to the line of action of the cable so we assume that this is the line of action of the cable and from cg it is e distance apart so we need to find out what is that another question we have find the tension in the fuselage at v ertical section aa and bb in the portion of the aircraft forward section aa if the portion of the aircraft forward section aa has a mass of one thousand, five hundred kg and the portion aft of section bb has a mass of five hundred kg this needs some additional figure that figure we will see later we will come back and do this portion aa this portion if we separate it out and this portion if we separate it out this portion a has one thousand, five hundred kg mass this portion is having one thousand, five hundred kg mass and this portion is having five hundred kg mass ok let us try to solve the first portion need to clean refer slide time two thousand, five hundred and twenty-three the problem is very simple ten degrees is given and acceleration is also given so that is what for the x direction is equation is drawn this type of problem you have solved many times so there is not much important given on it importance given on it where acceleration is 3g this is important three into nine hundred and eighty-one this is the t otal acceleration and t ma c os theta t is equals to this i d o not think there is explanation required please note that we are not considering any friction fy is equal to for the reaction we wish consider some of the forces in the vertical direction there are al so comes the t portion that sin theta portion of it and if we solve this simple equation we get r seventy-four thousand, nine hundred and forty-six newto n considering the moment about cg this point this is the point what we have we get the value of e as twenty-five cm i think you can solve it so the next portion refer slide time two hundred and sixty-five one consider the aft portion or the rear portion of the fuselage section bb w hich is having mass of five hundred kg with respective to multiply by g this is the total force acting here and this is the acceleration acting at this point so if we again consider summation of in the x direction what we have this is the force that is what is af t asked the force in this direction and thus that t1 becomes one hundred and thirty-two thousand, four hundred and thirty-four newton we take this component are this is the component for one hundred and forty-seven thousand, one hundred and forty-nine this this already you have found out so that is why this diagram have put it here in the vertical direction if we c onsider we can find out the shear force acting in this particular cross section similar manner if we consider the section left to the aa section the this is coming from the one thousand, five hundred kg load that is multiplied not shown here with g this is also multiplied not shown here with g and solving similar equations we get that t2 and v2 refer slide time two thousand, eight hundred and twenty-six but thing one thing by solving this example it is better to note that while it is arrested on a carrier for landing an aircraft is arrested by hook it experi ences a huge load that is in the range of say t2 of say forty-four kilo newton or here it is maybe one hundred and thirty-two kilo newton so this is not a very small amount of force and accordingly there are shear forces acting on it on the fuselage so unless these things are designed properly aircrafts are designed properly it may lead to catastrophic failure if you search internet nowadays internet is a big resource and that resource is really you may use it properly there are example videos of failure in this way it is arrested a nd front portion there is a vertical crack in the fuselage and the front portions goes to accident it is very bad type of failure ok let us go for the next e xample two refer slide time two thousand, nine hundred and fifty-three ok as i mentioned the acceleration following the alembert\u2019s t he previous example also before we do anything these example talks about landing impact and important part of in this example is the d alembert\u2019s following the d alembert\u2019s principle what is acting on ma so it is the deceleration and on depending on the d irection it is though the displacement in this direction \u2019s since it is deceleration the inertial load will be acting downwards so this point if you keep it in mind let us go to the problem now a one thousand, five hundred zero kg aircraft is shown at the time of landing impact when the ground reactio n on each main wheel is 225000g newton or 22500g newton if one wheel and tyre has a mass of two hundred and fifty kg find the compression c and bending moment m in the oleo strut if the strut is vertical and is fifteen cm from the centerline of the wheel to understand this language what is oleo strut oleo strut is the compression system axial compression shock absorbing system instead of compress system it is better to say shock absorbing system we absorb in your motorbike probably all of you are i ntroduced to motorbike if you look at the motor bike from of the suspension that is the kind of oleo strut suspension that type of su spension are also used to in aircraft that is known as oleo strut it is in vertical and fifteen cm from the center line of t he wheel so these portion if we look at i think this is the oleo strut portion this portion compresses to absorb the shock as well as since there is a distance between this and the reaction that reactions will introduce some bending movement and that ben ding movement m we need to find out refer slide time three thousand, two hundred and fifty-eight we have discussed in our last slide what the problem is and we have also discussed about why ma here it is acting downward and with respect to that first we need to find out the acceleration a which is not stated here to do that we consider the equilibrium in the vertical direction considering the y is the vertical direction if we write the equilibrium equation it is something like this and from there we get that a is equal to twice g once we get the value of a is equal to twice g we can find out the forces in the landing gear oleo strut oleo strut is the vertical forces here if you draw the free body diagram of the landing gear will this is the oleo strut as we have discussed it is the axi al shock absorbing member so the axial force we have given as c and the moment encountered here as m so here for this from your mechanics knowledge we can easily go for two equilibrium condition that is at the vertical equilibrium condition and conside ring the vertical equilibrium condition we get that the value of c two hundred and thirteen thousand, one hundred and fifty newton here this is a five hundred g ma because 2g is getting multiplied with the two hundred and fifty and that there is the reason for the moment what do we do we consider moment about this point if we c onsider the moment about this point what happens that this is actin g in the same direction that is in twenty-two thousand, five hundred g multiplied by fifteen is positive and the other negative portion that is seven hundred and fifty five hundred two hundred and fifty is considered here and that gives us the moment this way so le t us move to the next part of the problem refer slide time three thousand, four hundred and fifty-nine next part of the problems is that find the shear and bending moment at section aa of the wing if the wing outboard of this section has a mass of seven hundred and fifty kg so this portion is having a mass of seven hundred and fifty kg so this seven hundred and fifty kg is acting at three hundred kg and has its cg three hundred cm outboard of section aa so from here it is acting seven hundred and fifty g is the total force so this is a simple same mechanics knowledge we are supposed to use the vertical equilibrium equation is drawn seventy-one thousand, five hundred g is acting downward and then seven hundred and fifty g this is the inertia force this is the inertia force and this is a weight acting downward and that altogether makes the shear force in this section for moment we are considering moment about this point and we writ e the moment equation and we get this value so we will move forward for the next slide and we will see what we have refer slide time three thousand, six hundred and thirteen so standard reference we have used wh at we have learnt from this lecture is that a concept of finding out f light vehicle aerodynamic loads p rocess of calculation of load factor at different flight condition bending moment and shear force calculation while it is landing or it may be in different flight condition with example of landing we have learned how to find o ut how to consider the effect of inertia while we are finding out bending moment and shear force and with this let us end todays lecture thank you for attending this lecture we will meet again in our next lecture"}

we have already discussed history of solid mechanics or the structural analysis applicable to aerospace engineering different sizes and w ays the structures are in different configuration in case of aircraft structures then we have seen the development of aircraft structures since the beginning by wright brothers then flight envelope and load factor for various status we have already learnt so today what we will learn is that we will learn what is a flight maneuver and we wi ll learn symmetric flight maneuver refer slide t ime one hundred and forty-four along with that we will solve one problem to find out loads in that case so today\u2019s lecture we will cov er symmetric maneuver loads from a symmetric maneuver equations we will form and then we will solve one example refer slide t

aircraft it is in pullout maneuver before we look into the diagram on the right hand side better we read these bullets and along with that we follow it so in a rapid pullout from a dive a downwa rd load is applied to the tail plane causing the aircraft to pitch nose upward so what happens if an aircraft if we draw these way i get better i remove things here what it says that causing effort for aircraft to pitch up to pitch nose upwards so elev ator is going upward if we look at the section these way this is the way this elevator comes in this is the tail plane and the rapid pull out from a dive a downward load is applied to the tail plane so that applies the downward load in the total tail plan e and causing the aircraft to pitch nose upward that means it is moving this way that is what the v diagram is shown this way that is what is explained in the first topic so next if we look at the downward load is achieved by backward movement of the con trol column thereby applying negative incidence to the elevator so that is what just now we have drawn but control column moving backward this terminology is used with re spect to the pilot and control what happens there is a control rod something like thi s and then that is moved this way so to give it a pitch up movement that is what is said here achieved by backward movement of the control column is moved back thereby applying negative incidence to the elevator this way the elevator will move and negati ve incidence to the elevator or horizontal tail if the la tter is all moving so this is one case elevator is if it is not then the total tail plane moves like this in normal case it is like this but for pitching up movement it its rotat es this way so nex t if you talk about the maneuver is carried out rapidly the forward speed of the aircraft remains practically constant so that increase in the lift and drag result from the increase in wing incidence only so it is a kind of assum ption this is a kind of way we follow it that means we assume the forward speed practically constant and we assume also that the lift and drag result from the increase in the wing incidence only since the lift is now greater tha n the required to balance the aircraft weight the aircraft experiences an upward acceleration normal to its flight path so the total aircraft moves upward that is what is saved since the lift is now greater than that required to balance the aircraft weight the craft experiences an upward acceleration nor mal to its flight path this normal acceleration combined wi th the aircraft speed in the di ve results in the chord flight path shown in the figure so what is happening while it is coming down an aircraft is coming down then the pitch up movement is given and then it is following this way here only this potion is shown in this case how it is going on so if we look at the other parameters let us go to the next slide refer slide t ime seven hundred and fifty-nine as the dr ag load builds up with an increase of incidence forw ard speed of the aircr aft falls since the thrust is assume to remain constant during the maneuver so if the thrust is assumed constant the forward speed is definitely supp osed to fall so that is what is stated it is usually it is usual as we are you obser ved in the discussion of the flight envelope to describe the maneuvers of an aircraft in terms of the maneuvering load factor n so we supposed to find out the maneuvering load factor in terms of ways it is generally talked about the maneuver of how much g are depending on that the design is carried out for steady level flight n one this is simply to compare the n values giving one g flight although in fact the acceleration is zero so this is a very important understanding you may do there is no acceleration that is the reason it is saying that n one and it giving one g what is implied in this method of discussi on is that the inertia force on the aircraft in the level flight condition is one times its weight it follows that the vertical inertia from force on an aircraft carrying out and ng maneuver is nw refer slide ti me nine hundred and thirty-seven we may therefore replace the dynamic conditions of the accelerated motion by an equivalent set of static condition in which the applied loads are in equilibrium with the inertia forc es so we have expressed in terms of n how does it affect or affect the flight so that is what we say that the dynamic condition is replaced equivalent set of st atic condition thus in figure n is the maneuver load factor while f is the similar factor givi ng the horizontal inertia force here we see what the f comes this portion this is because of the maneuver in the vertical direction this is in the horizontal direction note that the actual normal acceleration in this particular case is n \u2013 one please note that this is because while there is no state and level flight it is under 1g but while it is in ng maneuver actually the normal accelerat ion is n 1g for vertical equilibrium of the aircraft we have referring to figures where the aircraft is shown at th e lowest point of the pullout this is considered as the lowest point of the pull out if it is moving this way the figure is shown for this position so we are supposed to consider the static condition and we are supposed to find out the equation that is what is shown here before we go into the equation better we have some discussion on the drive as we have already mentioned if we look at this is the aerodynamic center about which the moment is acting aerodynamics moment m0 is acting thrust is acting al ong this line which is a at a distance c perpendicular distance c from the cg drag is acting along the ac in this for direction backward thrust is definitely acting in this line and the distance between the drag and the cg is d and fw is as i said but wh at we have mentioned about the f w the horizontal inertia force that is acting in this direction so p is the lift acting on that the tail plane so with respect to that if we consider the vertical equilibrium equation is l ptlp t sin gamma i think there is a mismatch with the symbol here it is gamma here it is lambda please consider that gamma is equals to lambda otherwise again there will be some problem please consider this so let l p t sin lambda this the sin thrust sin component acting vertical and then nw is acting downward now for the horizontal equilibrium as we have seen the thrust component will come the thrust component has come this is the horizontal inertia force fw \u2013d drag is acting on the others equation so this is for vertical thi s is for horizontal equilibrium now about taking the moment and the pitching moment equilibrium about the aircraft cg is l into a this is the distance this i missed from figure it is quite clear lift multiplied by a drag multiplied by b it is acting this w ay it is acting the other way tc is also acting in this direction rotation direction so this and this both are acting in this direction and m0 is definitely in the same direction pl p multiplied by l lift is acting and we get the moment equation here on e thing point we should note that effect of pitching acceleration is assumed to be negligible so please note that we are not considering the pitching acceleration these pitching accelerations are generally considered for other aspects other study for cont rol consideration but here our consideration is not critical so we have neglected that point so with this understanding with a symmetric maneuver now we understand what is a general symmetric maneuver is and in that generic symmetric maneuver what are t he force components act this is the flight path followed it is at the bottom position of the flight and what are the forces acting on it lift acting on the wing p force acting on the tail plane forward inertia force fw particle inertia force n w is acting o n it thrust is acting with an angle lambda or gamma so with that consideration we have go t three equations this is the moment equation vertical and horizontal equation let us try to solve a problem and try to see how we can find out the force components lift track okay refer slide t ime one thousand, five hundred and thirty-five how to solve method of successive approximate approximation is most convenient for solution of these equations successive approximation we will follow we will see how do we get one after another the values and we w ill solve those it may be noted that there are a few difference with respect to the steady level flight cases so that successive approximation method has some difference it depends on what type of case what how many data are available depending on that we need to change the scheme of approximation the engine thrust is no longer directly related to the drag as the letter changes during the maneuver so drag changes during the maneuver because of it is orientation at different position the drag changes and it is not directly related to the t the steady level flight it is related to t but whereas in this particular case it is not related it changes generally the thrust is regarded as remaining constant and equal to the value appropriate to condition before the maneuver began so with this understanding we consider the thrust and in some specific case we also assume some other way let us say for a particular problem how do you solve do we solve problem refer slide t ime one thousand, seven hundred and nine this is one example in this example this is cl let us see what the example says the curves c d alpha and cmcg cd alpha cmcg for a light aircraft are shown in the figure these three values are given with respect to cl the aircraft weight is eight thousand newton its wing area is one hundred and forty-five meter square and its mean chord is one hundred and thirty-five meter determine the lift drag tail load and forward inertia force for a symmetric maneuver corresponding to n forty-five is a maneuver required for that this type of general symmetric maneuver and a speed of sixty meter per second assuming that engine of condition apply and that the air density is one thousand, two hundred and twenty-three kg per meter cube so for this particular problem it is also specified that the engine is off density is given so we will use that relevant aircraft dimensions are shown in the separate figure so this is the figure for the relevant aircraft dimensions in this figure there is a small correction please note that this is the point sorry on which it a cts not this point so keeping a note with that this in the diagram let us try to follow or solve the problem the cg distance from the center of pressure of tail plane is four hundred and eighteen meter wing chord line is this one the angle between the fuselage datum is two degree this is the flight path this is the angle alpha between chord and flight path and we need to find the alpha from the diagram depending on some iterative process this angle is given and let us see h ow can we find out the solution refer slide t ime one thousand, nine hundred and thirty so before we go into the detailed solution let us try to note the procedure follow ed there are three equations vertical equilibrium horizontal equilibrium and moment we need to follow an iterative method because as we seen in the last slide that the alpha cmcg cd alpha and cmcg these are dependent on cl coefficient of lift so with confir ming value with respect to t he cl will have to consider these values and will have to solve the problem so let us see first we will assume that in this particular case that p zero and if you consider the first equation if you use p zero t is stated to be zero so the equation boils down to l nw and then from the lnw from the detailed expression of l that is q half rho v square cl into s we will find out the value of cl and that will be our first value of cl now using this first value of cl from the plot de scribed in the previous page we can find out the value of alpha as well as cmcg and if we have the alpha and cmcg these alpha will result in some l parameter the length calculation and as well as the cmcg will be used to find out cl again but before that we will need the value of p so let us try to see what we can do the moment equation may be approximated to find out p now from the first equation using new value of p we get the modified cl refer slide t ime two thousand, one hundred and forty-four so let us see for this particular case how do you solve it fast approximation as it is said we neglect the tail load p this is the first approximation as it is mentioned we use the equation we get a l nw as i mentioned it that l with its detail formula that is half rho v square cl s is the wing area cl is the lift coefficient n omega equals to n omega so following this equation we get the value of cl n omega w value n is forty-five and w is already given and putting the other value as given twelve twenty-three density of air the speed and one hundred and forty-five is the win g area here was not there so please note s is there that value of s is equals to one forty-five yes it is one hundred and forty-five meter square so with that value of s we calculate the cl the first as a calculated value of cl and now using this cl value from this plot say for one thousand, one hundred and thirteen somewhere here we drop and we find out the value of alpha corresponding to that alpha value we get around one thousand, three hundred and seventy-five we get the cmcg seventy-five cmcg is this is alpha this cmcg so these values we get and the tail arm l from first figure we need to find out is that l four hundred and eighteen this alpha is the new alpha we are supposed to put here again this is the point and this component is and this small component whatever is this component so this is this component and this is this component so cos and sin part alpha two all these two hundred and thirty-one that is the reason we have the length corresponding to the tail arm and using this equation let us see how do we refer slide t ime two thousand, four hundred and twenty-nine so we have the value of l calculated that is l four thousand, one hundred and twenty-three meter and from the moment equation if we look at we c an consider that this is total la db m0 is equivalent to the aircraft pitching moment that is mcg and if you rewrite the equation in that form that is mcg \u2013 pl0 and the detail expression or expression of mcg which consists of half rho v square sc cmcg whe re c is the wing mean chord now substituting so from here we will get the value of p and that p value can be substituted from to the vertical equilibrium equation where initially we assume p zero and that we have put here p is put divided by l this expre ssion divided by l is put which is equals to nwt is zero in our problem now again to make it in the coefficie nt form we divide it by half rho v square s and we get the expression for cl which is equal to cl c the main aerodynamic chord divided by l and th en cmcg this cmcg with respect to the cl the previous cl value that is previous cl value was one thousand, one hundred and thirteen with that value this value is the previous cl value we can we have got the cmcg value and substituting those value we can have the new cl value note that the right hand side is nothing but the old cl value this is what is written here the old cl value one thousand, one hundred and thirteen and this portion is nothing but this one so we get a new value of cl so one iteration is done so this iteration we can repeat to get a refined value of cl so with this cl value with this new cl value from the plot we can find out again alpha we can again find the value of cmcg and with help of alpha and cmcg we can find out the new modified l we can find out the new value this d we can use this new c mcg value and we can have the new value of cl so that is what the iteration goes on so let us see in our next slide how the iteration takes place refer slide t ime two thousand, seven hundred and fifteen so in this we see the new value of cl will give alpha one hundred and thirty-three degree cmcg seventy-three from the plot substituting these values of alpha into equation b gives a second approximation of l namely l four thousand, one hundred and sixty-one this will modify the value of p and as we have described the new cl value we have equals to one thousand and ninety-nine since the three calculated value of cl are all extremely close further approximation will note give values of cl very much different to those above therefore we shall take cl equals to one thousand and ninety-nine and from the figure we calculate the v alue of cd that will give us th e drag here it gives us the drag the value of lift tail load drag and forward inertia force then as follows l is calculated from the standard formula all these values are put tail load p nw l those values are put and we have found that it is equals to one thousand newton drag is also put from the value half rho v square a cd and two thousand, seven hundred and ninety and the forward inertia force which is equals to the drag is twenty-seven ninety so considering t zero so with this what we conclude that for a symmetric general maneuver how the maneuver is what are the forces act on th at aircraft we have learnt and we have considering a standard plots how to solve a problem how to find out lift drag tail plane load forward inertia force all those things we have talked out refer slide t ime two thousand, nine hundred and nineteen so references are standard reference what we ha d followed in the previous slides refer slide time two thousand, nine hundred and twenty-four and at the conclusion slide if we see a symmetric maneuver is we have learnt how a symmetric maneuver takes place what are the condition loads from symmetric maneuver we have to solve and with that we have got a fe ar understanding at different flight scenario flight maneuver how do we find out loads experienced by an aircraft so with this slide we move to our end of today\u2019s lecture thank you for attending this lecture"}
{"audio_filepath": "/media/rishu/Data1/Code Playground/test_ai4b/wav/9.wav", "duration": 1742.29, "text": "lecture no nine shear and moment on wing an aircraft welcome back to aircraft structure s one this is professor anup ghosh from aerospace engineering department iit kharagpur we are in the second week lectures this is the four th lecture of second week so before we go into what we will be learning which is there in the first as a lecture topic shear and moment on wing of an aircraft refer slide t ime fifty-four so recapitulation if you talk about history already you have done for structural analysis to some extent on aircraft development conceptual details of typical aircraft we have done flight envelopes and load factors wh at is load factor how from flight envelope a load factor is determined during design various parts of aircraft how do we maintain a flight envelope all those things we have learnt loads from symmetric maneuver in the last class we have learnt we have see n how can we calculate loads for a symmetric maneuver refer slide t ime one hundred and forty-one and today what we will see that the shear and moment on wing how is it calculated how do we find out due to the aerodynamic load and unit load analysis for wing shear and moments so we will better we go for the unit load analysis first and then we will solve one problem to understand how do we fin d out shear and moments on wing refer slide t ime two hundred and thirteen so as we have already seen that we have discussed the air load on the wing and the equilibrium of the airplane as a whole in flight it is customary to replace the distributed air forces on an airfoil by two resultant forces lift and drag acting through the aerodynamic center of the airfoil plus a wing moment so for a str uctural engineer what finally we get the two lift and drag forces and one moment and that we need to consider and we will have to find out a stresses build in component members and will have to design the flow around the wing is not uniform in span wise dire ction thus the airfoil force coefficient cl cd and cm vary span wise along the wing this already we have seen with some diagram cl varie s lift varie s cd varie s drag varie s and moment also varies from root to the tip along the span any particular type of airplane is design to carry out a certain job or duty and to do that job requires a certain maximum airplane velocity so from the flight envelope already we have introduced with this we are repeating just to keep in mind that is a major factor for an airplane design with the maneuvering limited to certain maximum acceleration so that flight envelope gives us the maximum acceleration so if we why we are talking about if we do unit analysis then from that unit analysis we can easily go for any acceler ation level and the velocity from the velocity we can find out the acceleration from the envelop these limiting accelerations are usually specified with reference to the xy z axis of the airplane since the directions of the lift and drag forces change w ith angle of attack it is simpler and convenient in stress analysis to resolve all forces so since it is changes as it is mentioned it is reso lved and it reference to the xyz axis which remain fixed in direction relative to the airplane so it is generall y kept fixed and it is resolved and that way we generally continue refer slide t ime five hundred and twenty-eight so as a time saving element in the wing stress analysis it is customary to make unit load analysis for wing shears and moments so we are repeatedly saying we n eed to do usually do time saving for time saving unit loads but what is unit loads these are the following steps by which we describe it to some extent but it is difficult to understand simply going through this texts that is the reason we will solve one pr oblem in one direction here it is talked about many more direction more than one direction and we will see how that it is carried out so let us try to understand as far the text written here that as to assume a total arbitrary unit load acting on the wing in the z direction this arbitrary unit load please keep it mind it is not load one unit load does not mean that it is under unit magnitude one magnitude of load acting on the wing in the z direction through the aerodynamic center of the airfoil section and dist ributed span wise according to the to that of cl or lift coefficient so what we are saying that it is distributed along the lift position just to remember if we think of we have learnt this is the fuselage generally this is the distribution along the win g followed so accordingly cl is supposed to be distributed axial a similar total load as in one but acting in the x direction that is the reason to understand this reason so this is nothing but what we are talking about this cl is as we said that acts from the through the aerodynamics center so we can say this is the force acting okay this cl is acting here in this direction then the next it says that the similar total load as in one but acting in x direction in this direction and then to assume a total unit wing load acting in the z direction through the aerodynamic center and distributed span wise according to that of cd it was distributed according to cl next it is distributed along cd so that same cd is acting here and we are supposed to do the anal ysis similarly it is also acting this way then to assume unit wing moment which may be acting not this way acting this way and we have to solve that also but it appears from this discussion that we need to solve five unit problems and will need to keep th at solution for a particular set of wing so for time we cannot solve all the five problems what we will have to solve we will solve only one type of problem we will see how do we solve the problem and we will the same process we can apply for others and solv e it refer slide t ime nine hundred and nineteen so here is the problem what we will be solving today figure below shows the half wing plan form this is this figure we are talking about p lan form of a cantilever wing next figure shows a wing section at station zero this is this figure makes a less next figure we are talking about it says at station zero means we are talking saying that this is a station second station third fourth and consecutive stations numbered in this according to this length from this axis so this is t his way this is the leading edge this is the trai ling edge the reference y axis has been taken as forty chord line from here to here it is forty chord line this and this are the same representation which happens to be a straight line in this particular case i t is straight line but usually it is not because of complicated geometry and requirement or various section types of aerodynamics files airfoils used at different sections in normal modern days aircraft never this section airfoil is name same as this se ction airfoil section changes the shape also changes so depending upon that it is not a straight line that is why emphasis is given on that it is a straight line in this particular wing layout the total win g area is eleven thousand, seven hundred and sixty square inch for convenience a to tal unit distribution load of seventeen thousand, seven hundred and sixty pound is taken this is what we said i have mentioned while we were discuss in the last slide it is not one pound it is seventeen thousand, seven hundred and sixty pound to keep the make the analysis convenient it is not one load will be assumed acting on the half wing and acting upward in the z direction and through the airfoil aerodynamic center so along this line it is acting upward okay so this is the simple problem what we have there is a aerodyna mic load acting upward this way we are supposed to find ou t shear and moment it is as simple as that we have some dimensions let us see how do we do how do we find out those the span wise distribution of this load will be according to the cl lift coefficient span wise distribution for simplicity in this example it is it will be assumed constant so cl is assumed to be constant along the length of the wing refer slide t ime one thousand, two hundred and fifty-nine so here we come with some additional figure just to understand the problem first and then the modern tools computer tools with ex cel sheet we will solve the problem so let us see look at the problem first how it is already we have understood how what is this problem is this is a half wing this is this portion is fuselage this is the wing this is root section this is leading edge this is trailing edge already we know seventeen thousand, seven hundred and sixty equals to the area of the wing force is acting we are assumed element on the aerodynamic center line and this figure will help us in understanding let us see how it is acting we will also assume that the dis tribution of lift along chord is also unity so it is only one set of arrow is shown here it is not like that we are assuming that the distribution is uniform on this section and for understanding we can start with this section actually this is this sectio n we are trying to understand so this total force is acting upward this is a trapezoidal portion that is why this trapezoidal is drawn here we need the centroid how much far it is from this because we need to find out the moment so that distance and mul tiply it by the sum of resultant of the force acting there we will give us the moment equals to m1 the sum of all those forces will give us the shear v1 once we have shear and moment in this section we are considering the next section here this is this se ction if we understand the calculation up to this it is very simple we are assuming distribution in this direction also uniform this direction also you have considered already uniform so that load calculation point of view it has become easy in this sect ion for equilibrium consideration this v should act upward and this m1 should act in the opposite direction so what do we need to consider that similar way we are calculating one more resultant here we are again finding out the distance as at which the re sultant is acting from this figure so along with that to find out shear we need to add this also along with plus this will give us the v2 similarly this m1 plus this v1 multiplied by this distance say d plus say this is v prime v prime multiplied thi s say centroid distance c prime will give us the m2 so this is what we need t consider to find out m2 because m1 remains this also will act and then all three component will give us the m2 so once we understand this properly we can easily understand the rema in table so this calculation will carry out for moment about x so this in case this is the moment we are talking about we need to calculate the other moment also in the y direction that how can we calculate we have assumed that the force is acting along this direction so this lever arm will act for moment around this y axis so this force multiplied by this lever arm will give u s the section wise this section wise moments and then we will add up all those moments so actually it is acting on this aerod ynamic center so this is the fifteen and that fifteen is here that will be acting and giving us the my moment so keeping mind all this data we will go to the next slide or if possible if it supports will go to the axial set and will try to find out we will try to check the calculation how do we carry out the basic understanding should be clear here refer slide t ime one thousand, eight hundred and fifty-six okay so as we have seen we are starting with this station two hundred and forty we are starting with station two hundred and forty that is what two hundred and forty is given here chord leng th c is forty-eight inch as it is shown here and here lies as we assume that ratio of the span wise variation to the lift coefficient in terms of a unit distribution along the chord that is c bar l so that we are assuming to be unity we are not considering any variation so with respect to that there is no modification of running load per inch of wing that remains same forty-eight now average running load from this section and this section we are simply taking an arithmetic average and finding out the load distance of s tation between these two station two hundred and forty and two hundred and thirty-five is five and here all if you see this is two hundred and twenty and two hundred and five which is fifteen accordingly we have noted down all those points before we go to distance of average load for all the station also calculated strip load is as it is mentioned column five multiplied by column six that is column five multiplied by column six so average running load is thi s distance is this so the strip load acting on that particular strip is total this much twenty-four two in this particular segment it is this segment if you talk about this segment it is twenty-four thousand, two hundred and seventy-three now amount of centroid sorry arm to centroid of strip load here comes the trapezoidal centroid formula because as you look into it the chord is changing forty-eight forty-nine we use that formula and we find out that arm length as two forty-nine we have the load strip load we have the amount of arm length and accordingly we see that this shear remains same this will require to calculate the moment so this is the moment from previous section means as we were talking about this is similar to th at m1 from if well why we are calculating for m2 so for m2 while we are calculating this is moment from previous session is that moment due to the distributed load this is multiplication of this arm and this so this we are talking about this is column nine and column six that is strip load and distance between stations so this is it says mo ment from the previous sect ion it is actually the multiplication at the junction of previous section the shear multiplied by the distance so this is this shear multiplied by this distance so that is what we get here while will see the excel sheet will again understand it properly and this is the moment due to the strip load so this is as i mentioned this arm length multiplied by the strip load we are getting and column twelve this is the mx that is previous on e the previous m m1 or the previous secti on load m oment due to the shear this one that is the column ten and then the column eleven this one so all this four are making it to here it is column twelve the previous one section and then column ten that is column ten is because of the previous section shear and the distance and this is from the strip load and the centroid whatever we multiplied that is yes this two we are summing up and we are getting the moment so this is what we get fo r the mx and then if we look for the y axis the x distance from the aerodynamics center to the y reference axis so this is nothing but the fifteen o f that particular chord always this is fifteen of that particular chord and then average is considered and then o nce we have the aver age then it is simply the strip load as we have in column seven this is the strict and that average of distance is multiplied we get the moment y and this is the sum with respect to the pervious one and this one so some column some of this so accordingly we if we continue calculation following this process it become easy now a days with help of excel sheet we can easily modify we can easily carry out this type of calculation and one check is better to note here is that the shear or the su m of the st rip load is coming equals to seventeen thousand, seven hundred and sixty which is exactly the amount of load applied and that is the result unit load per unit square inch is applied on the wing and the calculation is carried out refer slide t ime two thousand, six hundred and forty-two so with respect to this let us before we finish let us look at the excel sheet what we have learned how can we carry out with help of the excel sheet here in this diagram we see assisting figures are also there complete table is also there so as were mentioning this is simple a verage so that excel sheet formula is used here it is divided by two and if we see this multiplication is carried simple way and we also carry out the other operation as described this is the sum of previous and this new one and then we are getting the s um value like that we calculate the mx moment we calculate the my moment as well as the shear acting on the section refer slide t ime two thousand, seven hundred and fifty-one so this diagram helps a lot for understanding and if we plot this excel is generally not used for plotting th is type of diagram but in this particular presentation it is easier to show us ing excel that is why excuse me column values are mx value is plotted with respect to the root section to the tip section here the shear force is plotted which is not a straigh t line if you look it carefully and this is the moment y which is also a curve and we can have a feeling how the moment various along the span for only lift we consider refer slide t ime two thousand, eight hundred and forty-two so with conclusion of today\u2019s lecture the reference is a s tandard reference is taken refer slide t ime two thousand, eight hundred and fifty and what we have learnt this week is that shear and moment on wing unit load analysis for wing shears and moments and similarly for other four components as we have discussed in the unit load case we ca n have some analysis we can keep the solution and we can use those solutions for in future design purpose thank you for attending this lecture with that let us conclude today\u2019s lecture we will meet again in the next lecture"}
